abstract = {Many studies suggest that high-density rain gauge networks are required to capture the rainfall heterogeneities necessary to accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle. However, equipping and maintaining a high-density rain gauge network will also involve high costs. Although many studies provided useful insights on the required accuracy of rainfall estimates to accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle, most of these studies focused on streamflow simulations, large river basins or urban environments. The objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in areal rainfall, estimated at several spatial resolutions, on hydrological simulations of a small ∼6.5 km2 rural lowland catchment. The approach followed in this study is to force a calibrated spatially-distributed hydrological model (SPHY) with rainfall retrieved from an X-band radar and various synthetic rainfall products, calculated using bootstrap samples of a varying number of radar pixels, treated as virtual rain gauge locations within the catchment. This enables us to determine the most appropriate resolution of rainfall data to accurately describe the hydrology of a small rural lowland catchment. We found that the use of one rain gauge to estimate the catchment's areal rainfall may lead to a potential error of more than six times the average hourly rainfall. This may lead to uncertainties in simulated discharge that approach 60{\%} of the average hourly discharge. More than 40 rain gauges are required to reduce the potential error in areal rainfall estimation to values {\textless}0.1 mm h−1. The associated uncertainty in discharge simulations is 20{\%} if 10 rain gauges are used, and 10{\%} if 40 rain gauges are used. The simulation of soil moisture contents and evapotranspiration rates are hardly affected by the number of rain gauges used to estimate the areal rainfall, which is due to the high saturated hydraulic conductivities of the top-soil. At least 12 gauges per km2 are required to capture the spatial rainfall variation that is present in radar rainfall estimates. Analysis of an individual 18-h rainfall event revealed that the uncertainty in peak areal rainfall estimated using one rain gauge may range between −100{\%} and 600{\%}. The associated uncertainty in simulated discharge for this event ranges between −67 and 233{\%}. With 25 rain gauges the uncertainty in simulated discharge is still in the range of −17 to 33{\%}.},

abstract = {Quantilemapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climatemodels. Although they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations, it has been found that quantile mapping can artificially corrupt future model-projected trends. Previous studies on the modification of precipitation trends by quantile mapping have focused on mean quan- tities, with less attention paid to extremes. This article investigates the extent to which quantile mapping algo- rithms modify global climate model (GCM) trends in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes indices. First, a bias correction algorithm, quantile delta mapping (QDM), that explicitly preserves relative changes in precipitation quantiles is presented. QDM is compared on synthetic data with detrended quantile mapping (DQM), which is designed to preserve trends in the mean, and with standard quantile mapping (QM). Next, methods are applied to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) daily precipitation projections over Canada. Performance is assessed based on precipitation extremes indices and results from a generalized extreme value analysis applied to annual precipitation maxima. QM can inflate the magnitude of relative trends in precipitation extremeswith respect to the rawGCM,often substantially, as compared toDQM and especiallyQDM.The degree of corruption intheGCMtrendsbyQMis particularly large for changes in long period return values. By the 2080s, relative changes in excess of1500{\%} with respect to historical conditions are noted at some locations for 20-yr return values, withmaximumchanges byDQMandQDMnearing1240{\%}and 1140{\%}, respectively, whereas raw GCM changes are never projected to exceed 1120{\%}},

For the gamma distribution adjustment, the number of dry days is not taken as a fixed parameter; rather, we propose a new methodology for handling dry days. We consider two cases: the first case is defined as having a greater number of simulated dry days than the observed number, and the second case is defined as the opposite. The present climate period was divided into calibration and validation sets. We evaluate the results of the two bias correction techniques using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric test and the sum of the differences between the cumulative distribution curves. These tests show that both correction techniques were effective in reducing errors and consequently improving the reliability of the simulations. However, the gamma distribution correction method proved to be more efficient, particularly in reducing the error in the number of dry days.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Much of our knowledge about future changes in precipitation relies on global (GCM) and/or regional climate models (RCM) that have resolutions which are much coarser than typical spatial scales of precipitation, particularly extremes. The major problems with these projections are both climate model biases and the gap between gridbox and point scale. Wong et al. developed a model to jointly bias correct and downscale precipitation at daily scales. This approach, however, relied on pairwise correspondence between predictor and predictand for calibration, and thus, on nudged simulations which are rarely available. Here we present an extension of this approach that separates the downscaling from the bias correction and in principle is applicable to free running GCMs/RCMs. In a first step, we bias correct RCM-simulated precipitation against gridded observations at the same scale using a parametric quantile mapping approach. To correct the whole distribution including extreme tails we apply a mixture distribution of a gamma distribution for the precipitation mass and a generalized Pareto distribution for the extreme tail. In a second step, we bridge the scale gap: we predict local variance employing a vector generalized linear gamma model (VGLM gamma) with the bias corrected time series as predictor. The VGLM gamma model is calibrated between gridded and point scale (station) observations. For evaluation we adopt the perfect predictor experimental setup of VALUE. Precipitation is in most cases improved by (parts of) our method across different European climates. The method generally performs better in summer than in winter and in winter best in the Mediterranean region with a mild winter climate and worst for continental winter climate in mid {\&} eastern Europe or Scandinavia. A strength of this two-step method is that the best combination of bias correction and downscaling methods can be selected. This implies that the concept can be extended to a wide range of method combinations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This article finds that this function of the error correction values cannot be assumed to be stationary. As a result, QM lacks justification to inflate/deflate various moments of the climate change signal. Previous adaptations of QM, most notably quantile delta mapping (QDM), have been developed that do not rely on this assumption of stationarity. Here, we outline a methodology called scaled distribution mapping (SDM), which is conceptually similar to QDM, but more explicitly accounts for the frequency of rain days and the likelihood of individual events. The SDM method is found to outperform QM, QDM and detrended QM in its ability to better preserve raw climate model projected changes to meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Whereas impact models typically require high resolution unbiased input data, global and regional climate models are in general biased, their resolution is often lower than desired. Thus, many users of climate model data apply some form of bias correction and downscaling. A fundamental assumption of bias correction is that the considered climate model produces skillful input for a bias correction, including a plausible representation of climate change. Current bias correction methods cannot plausibly correct climate change trends, and have limited ability to downscale. Cross validation of marginal aspects is not sufficient to evaluate bias correction and needs to be complemented by further analyses. Future research should address the development of stochastic models for downscaling and approaches to explicitly incorporate process understanding.},

If the observations are of similar resolution as the regional climate model, quantile mapping is a feasible approach. However, if the observations are of much higher resolution, quantile mapping also attempts to bridge this scale mismatch. Here, it is shown for daily precipitation that such quantile mapping–based downscaling is not feasible but introduces similar problems as inflation of perfect prognosis (“prog”) downscaling: the spatial and temporal structure of the corrected time series is misrepresented, the drizzle effect for area means is overcorrected, area-mean extremes are overestimated, and trends are affected. To overcome these problems, stochastic bias correction is required.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Water resources are essential to the ecosystem and social economy in the desert and oasis of the arid Tarim River Basin, Northwest China, and expected to be vulnerable to climate change. Regional Climate Models (RCM) have been proved to provide more reliable results for regional impact study of climate change (e.g. on water resources) than GCM models. However, it is still necessary to apply bias correction before they are used for water resources research due to often considerable biases. In this paper, after a sensitivity analysis on input meteorological variables based on Sobol' method, we compared five precipitation correction methods and three temperature correction methods to the output of a RCM model with its application to the Kaidu River Basin, one of the headwaters of the Tarim River Basin. Precipitation correction methods include Linear Scaling (LS), LOCal Intensity scaling (LOCI), Power Transformation (PT), Distribution Mapping (DM) and Quantile Mapping (QM); and temperature correction methods include LS, VARIance scaling (VARI) and DM. These corrected precipitation and temperature were compared to the observed meteorological data, and then their impacts on streamflow were also compared by driving a distributed hydrologic model. The results show: (1) precipitation, temperature, solar radiation are sensitivity to streamflow while relative humidity and wind speed are not, (2) raw RCM simulations are heavily biased from observed meteorological data, which results in biases in the simulated streamflows, and all bias correction methods effectively improved theses simulations, (3) for precipitation, PT and QM methods performed equally best in correcting the frequency-based indices (e.g. SD, percentile values) while LOCI method performed best in terms of the time series based indices (e.g. Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient, {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), (4) for temperature, all bias correction methods performed equally well in correcting raw temperature. (5) For simulated streamflow, precipitation correction methods have more significant influence than temperature correction methods and the performances of streamflow simulations are consistent with these of corrected precipitation, i.e. PT and QM methods performed equally best in correcting flow duration curve and peak flow while LOCI method performed best in terms of the time series based indices. The case study is for an arid area in China based on a specific RCM and hydrologic model, but the methodology and some results can be applied to other area and other models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We applied a One Health approach using human, veterinary and environmental data regarding the 2009 epidemic in The Netherlands, and investigated whether observed human Q fever incidence rates were correlated to environmental risk factors.We identified 158 putative sources (dairy goat and sheep farms) and included 2339 human cases. We performed a high-resolution (1 × 1 km) zero-inflated regression analysis to predict incidence rates by Coxiella burnetii concentration (using an atmospheric dispersion model and meteorological data), and environmental factors - including vegetation density, soil moisture, soil erosion sensitivity, and land use data - at a yearly and monthly time-resolution.With respect to the annual data, airborne concentration was the most important predictor variable (positively correlated to incidence rate), followed by vegetation density (negatively). The other variables were also important, but to a less extent. High erosion sensitive soils and the land-use fractions "city" and "forest" were positively correlated. Soil moisture and land-use "open nature" were negatively associated. The geographical prediction map identified the largest Q fever outbreak areas. The hazard map identified highest hazards in a livestock dense area. We conclude that environmental conditions are correlated to human Q fever incidence rate. Similar research with data from other outbreaks would be needed to more firmly establish our findings. This could lead to better estimations of the public health risk of a C. burnetii outbreak, and to more detailed and accurate hazard maps that could be used for spatial planning of livestock operations.},

abstract = {The Meuse is an important river in Western Europe, which is almost exclusively rain-fed. Projected changes in precipitation characteristics due to climate change, therefore, are expected to have a considerable effect on the hydrological regime of the river Meuse. We focus on an important tributary of the Meuse, the Ourthe, measuring about 1600 km2. The well-known hydrological model HBV is forced with three high-resolution (0.088°) regional climate scenarios, each based on one of three different IPCC CO2 emission scenarios: A1B, A2 and B1. To represent the current climate, a reference model run at the same resolution is used. Prior to running the hydrological model, the biases in the climate model output are investigated and corrected for. Different approaches to correct the distributed climate model output using single-site observations are compared. Correcting the spatially averaged temperature and precipitation is found to give the best results, but still large differences exist between observations and simulations. The bias corrected data are then used to force HBV. Results indicate a small increase in overall discharge, especially for the B1 scenario during the beginning of the 21st century. Towards the end of the century, all scenarios show a decrease in summer discharge, partially because of the diminished buffering effect by the snow pack, and an increased discharge in winter. It should be stressed, however, that we used results from only one GCM (the only one available at such a high resolution). It would be interesting to repeat the analysis with multiple models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

abstract = {Changes in water resources availability can be expected as consequences of climate change, population growth, economic development and environmental considerations. A two-stage modeling approach is used to explore the impact of these changes in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. An advanced, physically based, distributed, hydrological model is applied to determine the internal and external renewable water resources for the current situation and under future changes. Subsequently, a water allocation model is used to combine the renewable water resources with sectoral water demands. Results show that total demand in the region will increase to 393 km3yr-1in 2050, while total water shortage will grow to 199 km3yr-1in 2050 for the average climate change projection, an increase of 157 km3yr-1. This increase in shortage is the combined impact of an increase in water demand by 50{\%} with a decrease in water supply by 12{\%}. Uncertainty, based on the output of the nine GCMs applied, reveals that expected water shortage ranges from 85 km3yr-1to 283 km3yr-1∼in 2050. The analysis shows that 22{\%} of the water shortage can be attributed to climate change and 78{\%} to changes in socio-economic factors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {The hydrological regime of the Rhine basin is expected to shift from a combined snowmelt-rainfall regime to a more rainfall-dominated regime because of climate change, leading to more extreme flood peaks and low flows. Land use changes may reinforce the effects of this shift through urbanization or may counteract them through, for example, afforestation. In this study, we investigate the effect of projected land use change scenarios on river discharge. Sensitivity of mean and extreme discharge in the Rhine basin to land use changes is investigated at various spatial scales. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) (version 4.0.5) model is used for hydrological modeling forced by a high-resolution atmospheric data set spanning the period 1993-2003. The model is modified to allow for bare soil evaporation and canopy evapotranspiration simultaneously in sparsely vegetated areas, as this is more appropriate for simulating seasonal effects. All projected land use change scenarios lead to an increase in streamflow. The magnitude of the increase, however, varies among subbasins of different scales from about 2{\%} in the upstream part of the Rhine (about 60,000 km2) to about 30{\%} in the Lahn basin (about 7000 km2). Streamflow at the basin outlet proved rather insensitive to land use changes because over the entire basin affected areas are relatively small. Moreover, projected land use changes (urbanization and conversion of cropland into (semi)natural land or forest) have opposite effects. At smaller scales, however, the effects can be considerable.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors Many studies suggest that high-density rain gauge networks are required to capture the rainfall heterogeneities necessary to accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle. However, equipping and maintaining a high-density rain gauge network will also involve high costs. Although many studies provided useful insights on the required accuracy of rainfall estimates to accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle, most of these studies focused on streamflow simulations, large river basins or urban environments. The objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in areal rainfall, estimated at several spatial resolutions, on hydrological simulations of a small ∼6.5 km2rural lowland catchment. The approach followed in this study is to force a calibrated spatially-distributed hydrological model (SPHY) with rainfall retrieved from an X-band radar and various synthetic rainfall products, calculated using bootstrap samples of a varying number of radar pixels, treated as virtual rain gauge locations within the catchment. This enables us to determine the most appropriate resolution of rainfall data to accurately describe the hydrology of a small rural lowland catchment. We found that the use of one rain gauge to estimate the catchment's areal rainfall may lead to a potential error of more than six times the average hourly rainfall. This may lead to uncertainties in simulated discharge that approach 60{\%} of the average hourly discharge. More than 40 rain gauges are required to reduce the potential error in areal rainfall estimation to values {\textless}0.1 mm h−1. The associated uncertainty in discharge simulations is 20{\%} if 10 rain gauges are used, and 10{\%} if 40 rain gauges are used. The simulation of soil moisture contents and evapotranspiration rates are hardly affected by the number of rain gauges used to estimate the areal rainfall, which is due to the high saturated hydraulic conductivities of the top-soil. At least 12 gauges per km2are required to capture the spatial rainfall variation that is present in radar rainfall estimates. Analysis of an individual 18-h rainfall event revealed that the uncertainty in peak areal rainfall estimated using one rain gauge may range between −100{\%} and 600{\%}. The associated uncertainty in simulated discharge for this event ranges between −67 and 233{\%}. With 25 rain gauges the uncertainty in simulated discharge is still in the range of −17 to 33{\%}.},

abstract = {Rivers draining the southern Himalaya provide most of the water supply for the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plains. Despite the importance of water resources in light of climate change, the relative contributions of rainfall, snow and glacier melt to discharge are not well understood, due to the scarcity of ground-based data in this complex terrain. Here, we quantify discharge sources in the Sutlej Valley, western Himalaya, from 2000 to 2012 with a distributed hydrological model that is based on daily, ground-calibrated remote-sensing observation. Based on the consistently good model performance, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of hydrologic components and quantified their contribution to river discharge. Our results indicate that the Sutlej River's annual discharge at the mountain front is sourced to 55{\%} by effective rainfall (rainfall reduced by evapotranspiration), 35{\%} by snow melt and 10{\%} by glacier melt. In the high-elevation orogenic interior glacial runoff contributes {\~{}}30{\%} to annual river discharge. These glacier melt contributions are especially important during years with substantially reduced rainfall and snowmelt runoff, as during 2004, to compensate for low river discharge and ensure sustained water supply and hydropower generation. In 2004, discharge of the Sutlej River totaled only half the maximum annual discharge with 17.3{\%} being sourced by glacier melt. Our findings underscore the importance of calibrating remote-sensing data with ground-based data to constrain hydrological models with reasonable accuracy. For instance, we found that TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) product 3B42 V7 systematically overestimates rainfall in arid regions of our study area by a factor of up to 5. By quantifying the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources we provide an important assessment of the potential impact of global warming on river discharge in the western Himalaya. Given the near-global coverage of the utilized remote-sensing datasets this hydrological modeling approach can be readily transferred to other data-sparse regions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A considerable number of river basins around the world lack sufficient ground observations of hydro-meteorological data for effective water resources assessment and management. Several approaches can be developed to increase the quality and availability of data in these poorly gauged or ungauged river basins, and among those, the use of earth observations products has recently become promising. Earth observations of various environmental variables can be used potentially to increase the knowledge about the hydrological processes in the basin and to improve streamflow model estimates, via assimilation or calibration. The present study aims to calibrate the large-scale hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB using satellite-based products of evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the Moroccan Oum Er Rbia basin. Daily simulations at a spatial resolution of 5{\&}thinsp;arcmin{\&}thinsp;{\&}times;{\&}thinsp;5{\&}thinsp;arcmin are performed with varying parameters values for the 32-year period 1979{\&}ndash;2010. Five different calibration scenarios are inter-compared: (i) reference scenario using the hydrological model with the standard parameterization, (ii) calibration using in-situ observed discharge time series, (iii) calibration using GLEAM actual evapotranspiration time series, (iv) calibration using ESA CCI surface soil moisture time series and (v) step-wise calibration using GLEAM actual evapotranspiration and ESA CCI surface soil moisture time series. The impact on discharge estimates of precipitation in comparison with model parameters calibration is investigated using three global precipitation products, including EI, WFDEI and MSWEP. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Results show that GLEAM evapotranspiration and ESA CCI soil moisture may be used for model calibration resulting in reasonable discharge estimates (NSE values from 0.5 to 0.75), although better model performance is achieved when the model is calibrated with in-situ streamflow observations. Independent calibration based on only evapotranspiration or soil moisture observations improves model predictions to a lesser extent. Precipitation input affects to discharge estimates more than calibrating model parameters. The use of WFDEI precipitation leads to the lowest model performances. Apart from the in-situ discharge calibration scenario, the highest discharge improvement is obtained when EI and MSWEP precipitation products are used in combination with a step-wise calibration approach based on evapotranspiration and soil moisture observations. This study opens up the possibility to use globally available earth observations and reanalysis products of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture into large-scale hydrological models to estimate discharge at a river basin scale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The unprecedented availability of 6-hourly data from a multi-model ensemble that has been made available via the CMIP5 data archive for use in driving regional climate modelling experiments creates a wealth of opportunities to develop high-resolution downscaled climate projections relevant to detailed assessment of climate vulnerability and climate change impacts. Thus high resolution projections can be derived from the same set of models that are used to characterise the range of future climate changes, e.g. within IPCC assessment reports, and thus consistent with these ranges of global and large-scale regional projections. However, the technical and human resource requirements of downscaling, for example with a Regional Climate Model (RCM), are significant. To help address this issue we illustrate a methodology for sub-selecting from the available CMIP5 models in order to identify 8-10 GCMs which we will subsequently interface with the PRECIS RCM. The selection focuses on their suitability across multiple regions - South-east Asia, Europe and Africa. The sub-selection (a) avoids the inclusion of the least realistic models for each region and (b) simultaneously captures the maximum possible range of changes in surface temperature and precipitation for three continental-scale regions. We find that, of the GCMs with 6-hourly fields available, three simulate the key regional aspects of climate sufficiently poorly that we consider the projections from those models ‘implausible' (MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and IPSL-CM5B-LR). From the remaining models, we demonstrate a sub-selection methodology which avoids the poorest models by including them in the sub-set only if their exclusion would significantly reduce the range of projections sampled.},

abstract = {Abstract. As climate change is projected to alter both temperature and precipitation, snow-controlled mid-latitude catchments are expected to experience substantial shifts in their seasonal regime, which will have direct implications for water management. In order to provide authoritative projections of climate change impacts, the uncertainty inherent to all components of the modelling chain needs to be accounted for. This study assesses the uncertainty in potential impacts of climate change on the hydro-climate of a headwater sub-catchment of New Zealand's largest catchment (the Clutha River) using a fully distributed hydrological model (WaSiM) and unique ensemble encompassing different uncertainty sources: general circulation model (GCM), emission scenario, bias correction and snow model. The inclusion of snow models is particularly important, given that (1) they are a rarely considered aspect of uncertainty in hydrological modelling studies, and (2) snow has a considerable influence on seasonal patterns of river flow in alpine catchments such as the Clutha. Projected changes in river flow for the 2050s and 2090s encompass substantial increases in streamflow from May to October, and a decline between December and March. The dominant drivers are changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation (for the 2090s +29 to +84{\%} in winter) and substantial decreases in the seasonal snow storage due to temperature increase. A quantitative comparison of uncertainty identified GCM structure as the dominant contributor in the seasonal streamflow signal (44–57{\%}) followed by emission scenario (16–49{\%}), bias correction (4–22{\%}) and snow model (3–10{\%}). While these findings suggest that the role of the snow model is comparatively small, its contribution to the overall uncertainty was still found to be noticeable for winter and summer.},

abstract = {This paper argues that there are fundamental problems in the application of physically-based models for practical prediction in hydrology. These problems result from limitations of the model equations relative to a heterogeneous reality; the lack of a theory of subgrid scale integration; practical constraints on solution methodologies; and problems of dimensionality in parameter calibration. It is suggested that most current applications of physically-based models use them as lumped conceptual models at the grid scale. Recent papers on physically-based models have misunderstood and misrepresented these limitations. There are practical hydrological problems requiring physically-based predictions, and there will continue to be a need for physically-based models but ideas about their capabilities must change so that future applications attempt to obtain realistic estimates of the uncertainty associated with their predictions, particularly in the case of evaluating future scenarios of the effects of management strategies.},

Here, we present a process-based soil erosion model, based on the integration of the Morgan-Morgan-Finney erosion model in a daily-based hydrological model. The model overcomes many of the limitations of previous large-scale soil erosion models, as it includes a more complete representation of crucial processes like surface runoff generation, dynamic vegetation development, and sediment deposition, and runs at the catchment scale with a daily time step. This makes the model especially suited for evaluation of the impacts of environmental change on soil erosion and sediment yield at large spatial scales. The model was successfully applied in a large catchment in southeastern Spain. We demonstrate the models capacity to perform impact assessments of environmental change scenarios, specifically simulating the scenario impacts of intra- and inter-annual variations in climate, land management and vegetation development on soil erosion and sediment yield.},

To assess the impact of increased precipitation intensity on water security, we applied a regional scale hydrological and soil erosion model, forced with Regional Climate Model projections. We specifically considered the impact of climate change on the distribution of water between soil (green water) and surface water (blue water) compartments. We show that an increase in precipitation intensity leads to a redistribution of water within the catchment, where water storage in soil decreases and reservoir inflow increases. This affects plant water stress and the potential of rainfed versus irrigated agriculture, and increases dependency on reservoir storage, that is increasingly threatened by an increase of soil erosion. This study demonstrates the crucial importance of accounting for the fact that increased precipitation intensity leads to water redistribution between green and blue water, increased soil erosion, and reduced water security.},

abstract = {The sensitivities of runoff generation to rainfall variability and initial wetness conditions were examined for a major flash flood event that occurred during August 29, 2003 on the upper Tagliamento river basin in the eastern Italian Alps. The Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS) distributed hydrologic model was used to simulate the hydrologic response over a range of sub-basins. The model was calibrated for the single flash flood event based on the observed hydrograph at the outlet of the basin examined (Fella basin) and was validated based on the available observed hydrographs at interior points of the basin. A series of hydrologic simulations were performed for different initial soil moisture conditions and rainfall forcing resolutions in order to evaluate the sensitivity of runoff generation to those variables. Evaluation of the results suggests that both initial wetness and rainfall resolution affect significantly the simulated peak flow and runoff volume during the flash flood event. Sensitivity to initial wetness exhibits a scale dependence with the sensitivity increasing with basin scale. The bias introduced to the basin-averaged rainfall due to aggregation had a significant effect on runoff generation for all basin scales, while the effect of variability smoothing was important only for the larger scale basins. Finally, the sensitivity of the flood hydrograph to rainfall aggregation was shown to be more important for drier initial wetness states. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Rain gauges can offer high quality rainfall measurements at their locations. Networks of rain gauges can offer better insight into the space-time variability of rainfall, but they tend to be too widely spaced for accurate estimates between points. While remote sensing systems, such as radars and networks of microwave links, can offer good insight in the spatial variability of rainfall they tend to have more problems in identifying the correct rain amounts at the ground. A way to estimate the variability of rainfall between gauge points is to interpolate between them using fitted variograms. If a dense rain gauge network is lacking it is difficult to estimate variograms accurately. In this paper a 30-year dataset of daily rain accumulations gathered at 29 automatic weather stations operated by KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) and a one-year dataset of 10 gauges in a network with a radius of 5 km around CESAR (Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research) are employed to estimate variograms. Fitted variogram parameters are shown to vary according to season, following simple cosine functions. Semi-variances at short ranges during winter and spring tend to be underestimated, but semi-variances during summer and autumn are well predicted.},

abstract = {Rainfall depth-duration-frequency (DDF) curves describe rainfall depth as a function of duration for given return periods and are important for the design of hydraulic structures. This paper focusses on the effects of dependence between the maximum rainfalls for different durations on the estimation of DDF curves and the modelling of uncertainty of these curves. For this purpose the hourly rainfall depths from 12 stations in the Netherlands are analysed. The records of these stations are concatenated to one station-year record, since no geographical variation in extreme rainfall statistics could be found and the spatial dependence between the maximum rainfalls appears to be small. A generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is fitted to the 514 annual rainfall maxima from the station-year record for durations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h. Subsequently, the estimated GEV parameters are modelled as a function of duration to construct DDF curves, using the method of generalized least squares to account for the correlation between GEV parameters for different durations. A bootstrap estimate of the covariance matrix of the estimated GEV parameters is used in the generalized least squares procedure. It turns out that the shape parameter of the GEV distribution does not vary with duration. The bootstrap is also used to obtain 95{\%}-confidence bands of the DDF curves. The bootstrap distribution of the estimated quantiles can be described by a lognormal distribution. The parameter $\sigma$ of this distribution (standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution) is modelled as a function of duration and return period. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

WALRUS explicitly accounts for processes that are important in lowland areas, notably (1) groundwater–unsaturated zone coupling, (2) wetness-dependent flow routes, (3) groundwater–surface water feedbacks and (4) seepage and surface water supply. WALRUS consists of a coupled groundwater–vadose zone reservoir, a quickflow reservoir and a surface water reservoir. WALRUS is suitable for operational use because it is computationally efficient and numerically stable (achieved with a flexible time step approach). In the open source model code default relations have been implemented, leaving only four parameters which require calibration. For research purposes, these defaults can easily be changed.

Our results are based on empirical analyses of high-resolution rainfall and discharge observations over Harry's Brook watershed in Princeton, New Jersey, during 2005–2006, as well as numerical experiments with the Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) model. We focus on two subwatersheds of Harry's Brook, a 1.1 km2 subwatershed which was developed prior to modern storm water management regulations, and a 0.5 km2 subwatershed with an extensive network of storm water detention ponds. The watershed developed prior to modern storm water regulations is an “end-member” in urban flood response, exhibiting a frequency of flood peaks (with unit discharge exceeding 1 m3 s−1 km−2) that is comparable to the “flashiest” watersheds in the conterminous U.S. Observational analyses show that variability in storm event water balance is strongly linked to peak rain rates at time intervals of less than 30 min and only weakly linked to antecedent soil moisture conditions. Peak discharge for both the 1.1 and 0.5 km2 subwatersheds are strongly correlated with rainfall rate averaged over 1–30 min. Hydrologic modeling analyses indicate that the sensitivity of storm event hydrologic response to spatial rainfall variability decreases with storm intensity. Temporal rainfall variability is relatively more important than spatial rainfall variability in representing urban flood response, especially for extreme storm events.},

abstract = {Urban flash flooding is a serious problem in large, highly populated areas such as the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW). Being able to monitor and predict flash flooding at a high spatiotemporal resolution is critical to providing location-specific early warnings and cost-effective emergency management in such areas. Under the idealized conditions of perfect models and precipitation input, one may expect that spatiotemporal specificity and accuracy of the model output improve as the resolution of the models and precipitation input increases. In reality, however, due to the errors in the precipitation input, and in the structures, parameters and states of the models, there are practical limits to the model resolution. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of streamflow simulation in urban catchments to the spatiotemporal resolution of precipitation input and hydrologic modeling to identify the resolution at which the simulation errors may be at minimum given the quality of the precipitation input and hydrologic models used, and the response time of the catchment. The hydrologic modeling system used in this work is the National Weather Service (NWS) Hydrology Laboratory's Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HLRDHM) applied at spatiotemporal resolutions ranging from 250 m to 2 km and from 1 min to 1 h applied over the Cities of Fort Worth, Arlington and Grand Prairie in DFW. The high-resolution precipitation input is from the DFW Demonstration Network of the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) radars. For comparison, the NWS Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) product, which is available at a 4-km 1-h resolution, was also used. The streamflow simulation results are evaluated for 5 urban catchments ranging in size from 3.4 to 54.6 km2and from about 45 min to 3 h in time-to-peak in the Cities of Fort Worth, Arlington and Grand Prairie. The streamflow observations used in evaluation were obtained from water level measurements via rating curves derived from 1-D steady-state non-uniform hydraulic modeling. The results indicate that a spatiotemporal resolution of 500 m and 15 min or higher is a good choice for streamflow prediction using HLRDHM and CASA QPE in the study area, but that, due to the nonlinear accretion of random errors in QPE and imperfect model dynamics, there are trade-offs to consider among resolution, timeliness of prediction and prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Soil information in New Zealand comprises maps and databases of varying accuracy and platforms. A project has been initiated to bring together this soil information in S-map – a new multi-layer soil database with national coverage. An important difference is that S-map is designed as a digital product and is thus not constrained by cartographic requirements. Rather than generalising polygons for aesthetic reasons, the best available information is now used regardless of its scale of origin. Also climate and topography are no longer used as soil descriptors. Key goals are to capture the fundamental soil inputs required by pedotransfer functions, and to record knowledge of uncertainty. This will then act as a platform for fusion with other environmental layers for spatial modelling. S-map will contain data predominantly new to the existing national spatial soil database. Gaps will be filled and previous low-resolution data will be upgraded. The aim is to provide digital data layers of soil classes and attributes with resolution at least equivalent to 1:50 000. Work in the lowlands is proceeding using conventional soil survey techniques. In the uplands (where relief is sufficient to make effective use of the national 25-m resolution DEM) modelling approaches are used with the technique depending on data type and terrain. There are some enormous challenges in this work including nationwide soil correlation, devising a common structure for lowland (good information) and upland (little information) soils, providing information about soil variability and uncertainty, and developing a model-base of pedotransfer functions that can be easily updated. This paper describes our approach and progress in solving these challenges.},

abstract = {Obesity has traditionally been thought of as a state of caloric imbalance, where the intake of calories exceeds the expenditure or 'burning' of calories. However, a more nuanced appreciation for the complex biochemistry and physiology of cellular energy generation suggests that obesity is a state of hormonal imbalance causing increased shunting of food energy into adipose tissue for storage, resulting in decreased satiety and ultimately leading to increased caloric intake. Adding to this hypothesis, we propose that obesity is also a state of nutrient and energy deficit, leading to decreased fatty acid mobilisation and oxidation, the result of which may be a natural disinclination towards physical activity. Added sugars (sucrose, a.k.a. table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) may provide energy (4 kcal/g) but at current intakes they do not facilitate-and may even hinder-the production of energy. Not only do added sugars displace nutritionally superior foods in the diet, but they may also deplete nutrients from other foods that have been consumed, as well as from body stores, in order to enable their proper oxidation and liberate their calories as energy. Additionally, the consumption of added sugars damages the mitochondria and hence impairs energy generation. Moreover, overconsuming added sugars may result in a kind of 'internal starvation' (via leptin and insulin resistance) leading to further hunger signals in the body. Added sugars promote nutrient and energy deficit and through this novel pathway promote obesity.},

These irregularly-spaced locations, hence referred to as “data points,” may have diverse meanings: in meterology, weather observation stations; in geography, surveyed locations; in city and regional planning, centers of data-collection zones; in biology, observation locations. It is assumed that a unique number (such as rainfall in meteorology, or altitude in geography) is associated with each data point. In order to display these data in some type of contour map or perspective view, to compare them with data for the same region based on other data points, or to analyze them for extremes, gradients, or other purposes, it is extremely useful, if not essential, to define a continuous function fitting the given values exactly. Interpolated values over a fine grid may then be evaluated. In using such a function it is assumed that the original data are without error, or that compensation for error will be made after interpolation.},

abstract = {The performance of urban drainage systems is typ-ically examined using hydrological and hydrodynamic models where rainfall input is uniformly distributed, i.e., derived from a single or very few rain gauges. When models are fed with a single uniformly distributed rainfall realization, the re-sponse of the urban drainage system to the rainfall variabil-ity remains unexplored. The goal of this study was to understand how climate variability and spatial rainfall variability, jointly or individually considered, affect the response of a calibrated hydrodynamic urban drainage model. A stochas-tic spatially distributed rainfall generator (STREAP – Space-Time Realizations of Areal Precipitation) was used to sim-ulate many realizations of rainfall for a 30-year period, ac-counting for both climate variability and spatial rainfall vari-ability. The generated rainfall ensemble was used as input into a calibrated hydrodynamic model (EPA SWMM – the US EPA's Storm Water Management Model) to simulate sur-face runoff and channel flow in a small urban catchment in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland. The variability of peak flows in response to rainfall of different return periods was evaluated at three different locations in the urban drainage network and partitioned among its sources. The main con-tribution to the total flow variability was found to originate from the natural climate variability (on average over 74 {\%}). In addition, the relative contribution of the spatial rainfall variability to the total flow variability was found to increase with longer return periods. This suggests that while the use of spatially distributed rainfall data can supply valuable infor-mation for sewer network design (typically based on rainfall with return periods from 5 to 15 years), there is a more pro-nounced relevance when conducting flood risk assessments for larger return periods. The results show the importance of using multiple distributed rainfall realizations in urban hy-drology studies to capture the total flow variability in the re-sponse of the urban drainage systems to heavy rainfall events.},

abstract = {Urban catchments are typically characterised by high spatial variability and fast runoff processes resulting in short response times. Hydrological analysis of such catchments requires high resolution precipitation and catchment information to properly represent catchment response. This study investigated the impact of rainfall input resolution on the outputs of detailed hydrodynamic models of seven urban catchments in North-West Europe. The aim was to identify critical rainfall resolutions for urban catchments to properly characterise catchment response. Nine storm events measured by a dual-polarimetric X-band weather radar, located in the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) of the Netherlands, were selected for analysis. Based on the original radar estimates, at 100 m and 1 min resolutions, 15 different combinations of coarser spatial and temporal resolutions, up to 3000 m and 10 min, were generated. These estimates were then applied to the operational semi-distributed hydrodynamic models of the urban catchments, all of which have similar size (between 3 and 8 km2), but different morphological, hydrological and hydraulic characteristics. When doing so, methodologies for standardising model outputs and making results comparable were implemented. Results were analysed in the light of storm and catchment characteristics. Three main features were observed in the results: (1) the impact of rainfall input resolution decreases rapidly as catchment drainage area increases; (2) in general, variations in temporal resolution of rainfall inputs affect hydrodynamic modelling results more strongly than variations in spatial resolution; (3) there is a strong interaction between the spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall input estimates. Based upon these results, methods to quantify the impact of rainfall input resolution as a function of catchment size and spatial-temporal characteristics of storms are proposed and discussed.},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal variability of rainfall, especially at fine temporal and spatial scales can significantly affect flood generation, leading to a large variability in the flood response and uncertainty in its prediction. In this study we quantify the impact of rainfall spatial and temporal structure on the catchment hydrological response based on a numerical experiment. Rainfall ensembles generated using a state-of-the-art space-time stochastic model are used as input into a distributed process-based hydrological model. The sensitivity of the hydrograph to several structural characteristics of storm rainfall for three soil moisture initial conditions is numerically assessed at the basin outlet of an Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. The results highlight that the flood response is strongly affected by the temporal correlation of rainfall and to a lesser extent by its spatial variability. Initial soil moisture conditions play a paramount role in mediating the response. We identify the underlying mechanistic explanations in terms of runoff generation and connectivity of saturated areas that determine the sensitivity of flood response to the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall. We show that the element that mostly influences both the flood peak and the time of peak occurrence is the clustering of saturated areas in the catchment which leads to local enhanced runoff. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The new method, besides allowing spatial information to be incorporated into the modelling and estimation process, also allows temporal information to be incorporated. This technique employs temporal data as secondary co-kriged variables. The approach can be considered both straightforward and practical as far as design and programming aspects are concerned. Co-kriging with external drift leads to significant improvements in the results compared with typical radar estimates. It also seems to be more advantageous than kriging with external drift in modelling stability terms. Evidence is provided showing the advantages of co-kriging with external drift modelling over kriging with external drift. The difference becomes particularly pronounced for non-robust input data. The theoretical background and mathematical structure of the method is demonstrated. The method has been applied to four events, three during summer and one during winter, that took place over the complex Swiss orography. It is shown that cross-validation skill scores improve when the aggregation period of the input data increases from ten minutes to one hour. This improvement can be attributed to the increasing robustness of the input data with the period of aggregation. Moreover, a straightforward disaggregation scheme, which starts from hourly precipitation maps, produced by means of the aforementioned geostatistical technique and generating precipitation estimates at a temporal resolution of five minutes, is proposed.},

abstract = {It is well acknowledged that there are large uncertainties associated with radarbased estimates of rainfall. Numerous sources of these errors are due to parameter estimation, the observational system and measurement principles, and not fully understood physical processes. Propagation of these uncertainties through all models for which radarrainfall are used as input (e.g., hydrologic models) or as initial conditions (e.g., weather forecasting models) is necessary to enhance the understanding and interpretation of the obtained results. The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive literature review of the principal sources of error affecting single polarization radar-based rainfall estimates. These include radar miscalibration, attenuation, ground clutter and anomalous propagation, beam blockage, variability of the Z–R relation, range degradation, vertical variability of the precipitation system, vertical air motion and precipitation drift, and temporal sampling errors. Finally, the authors report some recent results from empirically-based modeling of the total radar-rainfall uncertainties. The bibliography comprises over 200 peer reviewed journal articles.},

abstract = {Runoff and flash flood generation are very sen-sitive to rainfall's spatial and temporal variability. The in-creasing use of radar and satellite data in hydrological ap-plications, due to the sparse distribution of rain gauges over most catchments worldwide, requires furthering our knowl-edge of the uncertainties of these data. In 2011, a new super-dense network of rain gauges containing 14 stations, each with two side-by-side gauges, was installed within a 4 km 2 study area near Kibbutz Galed in northern Israel. This net-work was established for a detailed exploration of the un-certainties and errors regarding rainfall variability within a common pixel size of data obtained from remote sensing systems for timescales of 1 min to daily. In this paper, we present the analysis of the first year's record collected from this network and from the Shacham weather radar, located 63 km from the study area. The gauge–rainfall spatial cor-relation and uncertainty were examined along with the esti-mated radar error. The nugget parameter of the inter-gauge rainfall correlations was high (0.92 on the 1 min scale) and increased as the timescale increased. The variance reduction factor (VRF), representing the uncertainty from averaging a number of rain stations per pixel, ranged from 1.6 {\%} for the 1 min timescale to 0.07 {\%} for the daily scale. It was also found that at least three rain stations are needed to adequately represent the rainfall (VRF {\textless} 5 {\%}) on a typical radar pixel scale. The difference between radar and rain gauge rainfall was mainly attributed to radar estimation errors, while the gauge sampling error contributed up to 20 {\%} to the total dif-ference. The ratio of radar rainfall to gauge-areal-averaged rainfall, expressed by the error distribution scatter parameter, decreased from 5.27 dB for 3 min timescale to 3.21 dB for the daily scale. The analysis of the radar errors and uncertainties suggest that a temporal scale of at least 10 min should be used for hydrological applications of the radar data. Rainfall measurements collected with this dense rain gauge network will be used for further examination of small-scale rainfall's spatial and temporal variability in the coming years.},

abstract = {Rain gauge networks provide rainfall measurements with a high degree of accuracy at specific locations but, in most cases, the instruments are too sparsely distributed to accurately capture the high spatial and temporal variability of precipitation systems. Radar and satellite remote sensing of rainfall has become a viable approach to address this problem effectively. However, among other sources of uncertainties, the remote-sensing based rainfall products are unavoidably affected by sampling errors that need to be evaluated and characterized. Using a large data set (more than six years) of rainfall measurements from a dense network of 50 rain gauges deployed over an area of about 135 km2 in the Brue catchment (south-western England), this study sheds some light on the temporal and spatial sampling uncertainties: the former are defined as the errors resulting from temporal gaps in rainfall observations, while the latter as the uncertainties due to the approximation of an areal estimate using point measurements. It is shown that the temporal sampling uncertainties increase with the sampling interval according to a scaling law and decrease with increasing averaging area with no strong dependence on local orography. On the other hand, the spatial sampling uncertainties tend to decrease for increasing accumulation time, with no strong dependence on location of the gauge within the pixel or on the gauge elevation. For the evaluation of high resolution satellite rainfall products, a simple rule is proposed for the number of rain gauges required to estimate areal rainfall with a prescribed accuracy. Additionally, a description is given of the characteristics of the rainfall process in the area in terms of spatial correlation.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a non-stationary stochastic generator for radar rainfall fields based on the Short-Space Fourier Transform (SSFT). The statistical properties of rainfall fields often exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity due to differences in the involved physical processes and influence of orographic forcing. The traditional approach to simulate stochastic rainfall fields based on the Fourier filtering of white noise, also known as fractional Brownian noise integration, is only able to reproduce the global power spectrum and spatial autocorrelation of the precipitation fields. Conceptually similar to wavelet analysis, the SSFT is a simple and effective extension of the Fourier transform developed for space-frequency localisation, which allows using windows to better capture the local statistical structure of rainfall. The SSFT is used to generate stochastic noise and precipitation fields that replicate the local spatial correlation structure, i.e. anisotropy and correlation range, of the observed radar rainfall fields. The potential of the stochastic generator is demonstrated using four precipitation cases observed by the 4th generation of Swiss weather radars that display significant non-stationarity due to the coexistence of stratiform and convective precipitation, differential rotation of the weather system and locally varying anisotropy. The generator is verified in its ability to reproduce both the global and the local Fourier power spectra of the precipitation field. The SSFT-based stochastic generator can be applied and extended to improve the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation, design storm simulation, stochastic NWP downscaling and also for other geophysical applications involving the simulation of complex non-stationary fields.},

abstract = {High-resolution space-time stochastic models for precipitation are crucial for hydrological applications related to flood risk and water resources management. In this study, we present a new stochastic space-time model, STREAP, which is capable of reproducing essential features of the statistical structure of precipitation in space and time for a wide range of scales, and at the same time can be used for continuous simulation. The model is based on a three-stage hierarchical structure that mimics the precipitation formation process. The stages describe the storm arrival process, the temporal evolution of areal mean precipitation intensity and wet area, and the evolution in time of the two-dimensional storm structure. Each stage of the model is based on appropriate stochastic modeling techniques spanning from point processes, multivariate stochastic simulation and random fields. Details of the calibration and simulation procedures in each stage are provided so that they can be easily reproduced. STREAP is applied to a case study in Switzerland using 7 years of high-resolution (2 × 2 km2; 5 min) data from weather radars. The model is also compared with a popular parsimonious space-time stochastic model based on point processes (space-time Neyman-Scott) which it outperforms mainly because of a better description of spatial precipitation. The model validation and comparison is based on an extensive evaluation of both areal and point scale statistics at hydrologically relevant temporal scales, focusing mainly on the reproduction of the probability distributions of rainfall intensities, correlation structure, and the reproduction of intermittency and wet spell duration statistics. The results shows that a more accurate description of the space-time structure of precipitation fields in stochastic models such as STREAP does indeed lead to a better performance for properties and at scales which are not used in model calibration.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {In the Dry Andes of central Chile, summer water resources originate mostly from snowmelt and ice melt. We use the physically based, spatially distributed hydrological model TOPKAPI to study the exchange between glaciers and climate in the upper Aconcagua River Basin during the summer season and identify the model parameters that are robust and transferable and those that are more dependent on calibration. TOPKAPI has recently been adapted to incorporate an enhanced temperature index approach for snow and ice melting. We suggest a calibration procedure that allows calibration of parameters in three steps by separating parameters governing distinct processes. We evaluate the parameters' transferability in time and in space by applying the model at two spatial scales. TOPKAPI's ability to simulate the relevant processes is tested against meteorological, ablation, and glacier runoff data measured on Juncal Norte Glacier during two glacier ablation seasons. The model was applied successfully to the climatic setting of the Dry Andes once its parameters were recalibrated. We found a clear distinction between parameters that are stable in time and those that need recalibration. The parameters of the melt model are transferable from one season to the other, while the parameters governing the extrapolation of meteorological input data and the routing of glacier meltwater need recalibration from one season to the other. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the model is most sensitive to the temperature lapse rate governing the extrapolation of air temperature from point measurements to the glacier scale and to the melt parameter that multiplies the shortwave radiation balance.},

abstract = {The HYPE model is a hydrological model for small-scale and large-scale assessments of water resources and water quality, developed at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute during 2005-2007. In the model, the landscape is divided into classes according to soil type, land use and altitude. In agricultural lands the soil is divided into three layers, each with individual computations of soil wetness and nutrient processes. The model simulates water flow and transport and turnover of nitrogen and phosphorus. Nutrients follow the same pathways as water in the model: surface runoff, macropore flow, tile drainage and outflow from individual soil layers. Rivers and lakes are described separately with routines for turnover of nutrients in each environment. Model parameters are global, or coupled to soil type or land use. The model was evaluated both by local calibrations to internal variables from different test basins and to data on discharge and nutrients from a large number of small basins. In addition, the estimated parameters were transferred to two larger basins in southern Sweden: River R{\"{o}}nne{\`{a}} and River Vind{\aa}n. The resulting simulations were generally in good agreement with observations.},

@article{Giorgi_1991,
abstract = {The increasing demand by the scientific community, policy makers, and the public for realistic projections of possible regional impacts of future climate changes has rendered the issue of regional climate simulation critically important. The problem of projecting regional climate changes can be identified as that of representing effects of atmospheric forcings on two different spatial scales: large-scale forcings, i.e., forcings which modify the general circulation and determine the sequence of weather events which characterize the climate regime of a given region (for example, greenhouse gas abundance), and mesoscale forcings, i.e., forcings which modify the local circulations, thereby regulating the regional distribution of climatic variables (for example, complex mountainous systems). General circulation models (GCMs) are the main tools available today for climate simulation. However, they are run and will likely be run for the next several years at resolutions which are too coarse to adequately describe mesoscale forcings and yield accurate regional climate detail. This paper presents a review of these approaches. They can be divided in three broad categories: (1) Purely empirical approaches, in which the forcings are not explicitly accounted for, but regional climate scenarios are constructed by using instrumental data records or paleoclimatic analogues; (2) semiempirical approaches, in which GCMs are used to describe the atmospheric response to large-scale forcings of relevance to climate changes, and empirical techniques account for the effect of mesoscale forcings; and (3) modeling approaches, in which mesoscale forcings are described by increasing the model resolution only over areas of interest. Since they are computationally inexpensive, empirical and semiempirical techniques have been so far more widely used. Their application to regional climate change projection is, however, limited by their own empiricism and by the availability of data sets of adequate quality. More recently, a nested GCM-limited area model methodology for regional climate simulation has been developed, with encouraging preliminary results. As it is physically, rather than empirically, based, the nested modeling framework has a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic factors associated with damming and water abstraction, and the resultant environmental pressures, are reviewed in six African river catchments using records and forecasts of climatic, demographic, and land-use change. Changes in the states of the flow regime through catchment drainage systems to the coastal sea are considered in conjunction with climate change and other human-induced pressures. The impacts of these changes on downstream and coastal environments and their communities are described in past, present, and future perspectives. Linkages between the issues and the pressures of damming and water abstraction are appraised and scientific, policy, and management responses proposed aimed at remedying existing and perceived future negative impacts. The study proposes that there is a need to integrate catchment and coastal management to account for the whole water flow regime together with its human dimensions. Management priorities relating to the operation of existing damming and abstraction schemes and planning of future schemes include the following: consideration of ways in which water discharges could be adjusted to provide improvements in downstream and coastal environmental and socioeconomic conditions; addressing the problem of sediment trapping impacting on the sustainability of dam reservoirs; and assessment of downstream and coastal impacts of future schemes in the light of climate change forecasts.},

abstract = {There are many models that attempt to predict physical processes in snow on the ground for a range of applications, and evaluations of these models show that they have a wide range of behaviours. A review of snow models, however, shows that many of them draw on a relatively small number of process parameterizations combined in different configurations and using different parameter values. A single model that combines existing parameterizations of differing complexity in many different configurations to generate large ensembles of simulations is presented here. The model is driven and evaluated with data from four winters at an alpine site in France. Consideration of errors in simulations of snow mass, snow depth, albedo and surface temperature show that there is no " best" model, but there is a group of model configurations that give consistently good results, another group that give consistently poor results, and many configurations that give good results in some cases and poor results in others. There is no clear link between model complexity and performance, but the most consistent results come from configurations that have prognostic representations of snow density and albedo and that take some account of storage and refreezing of liquid water within the snow. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The food-producing regions of the world increasingly rely on irrigation from groundwater resources. Further increases of groundwater use can adversely affect the sustainability of irrigated agriculture and put food security at risk. Sustainability of irrigation at field scale with groundwater is obtained if groundwater recharge is in equilibrium with tubewell extractions and capillary rise. Traditional information on phreatic surface behaviour does not explain the processes causing a phreatic surface to decline or incline. In this study, the physically based numerical model Soil–Water–Atmosphere–Plant (SWAP) was applied to compute soil moisture content and vertical soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone for the cotton–wheat and rice–wheat cropping system of Punjab, Pakistan. SWAP has been calibrated and verified with in situ measurements of soil moisture content and evapotranspiration fluxes measured by means of the Bowen ratio surface energy balance technique. Accurate data of the soil hydraulic properties are critical for the calibration of the soil moisture distribution. With knowledge of the van Genuchten–Mualem parameters available, SWAP could be applied to assess recharge and capillary rise for most field conditions, including basin irrigation. The results under Pakistani conditions show that deep percolation cannot always be estimated from root zone water balances. An annual recharge of 23.3 cm was computed for the cotton–wheat area. Sustainability of irrigation with groundwater is obtained if a reduction in irrigation with groundwater by 36{\%} is obtained. An annual recharge of 38.9 cm is estimated in rice–wheat systems, and a reduction of 62{\%} in groundwater extraction is required to reach sustainability of groundwater use at field scale. Such information cannot be obtained from classical phreatic surface fluctuation data, and unsaturated zone modelling therefore provides additional insights for groundwater policy making.},

@article{Hagemann2004,
abstract = {This study presents a model intercomparison of four regional climate models (RCMs) and one variable resolution atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) applied over Europe with special focus on the hydrological cycle and the surface energy budget. The models simulated the 15 years from 1979 to 1993 by using quasi-observed boundary conditions derived from ECMWF re-analyses (ERA). The model intercomparison focuses on two large atchments representing two different climate conditions covering two areas of major research interest within Europe. The first is the Danube catchment which represents a continental climate dominated by advection from the surrounding land areas. It is used to analyse the common model error of a too dry and too warm simulation of the summertime climate of southeastern Europe. This summer warming and drying problem is seen in many RCMs, and to a less extent in GCMs. The second area is the Baltic Sea catchment which represents maritime climate dominated by advection from the ocean and from the Baltic Sea. This catchment is a research area of many studies within Europe and also covered by the BALTEX program. The observed data used are monthly mean surface air temperature, precipitation and river discharge. For all models, these are used to estimate mean monthly biases of all components of the hydrological cycle over land. In addition, the mean monthly deviations of the surface energy fluxes from ERA data are computed. Atmospheric moisture fluxes from ERA are compared with those of one model to provide an independent estimate of the convergence bias derived from the observed data. These help to add weight to some of the inferred estimates and explain some of the discrepancies between them. An evaluation of these biases and deviations suggests possible sources of error in each of the models. For the Danube catchment, systematic errors in the dynamics cause the prominent summer drying problem for three of the RCMs, while for the fourth RCM this is related to deficiencies in the land surface parametrization. The AGCM does not show this drying problem. For the Baltic Sea catchment, all models similarily overestimate the precipitation throughout the year except during the summer. This model deficit is probably caused by the internal model parametrizations, such as the large-scale condensation and the convection schemes},

abstract = {This paper describes the application of a networked version of TOPMODEL, TOPNET, as part of the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP). The model implementation is based on a topographically derived river network with spatially distributed sub-basins draining to each network reach. The river network is mapped from the US National Elevation Dataset Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using procedures that objectively estimate drainage density from geomorphic principles. Rainfall inputs are derived from NEXRAD (radar) for each sub-basin. For each sub-basin, the wetness index distribution is derived from the DEM. The initial model parameters for each sub-basin are estimated using look up tables based on soils (STATSGO) and vegetation (1-km AVHRR). These initial model parameters provide the spatially distributed pattern of parameters at the scale of each sub-basin. Calibration uses a multiplier for each parameter to adjust the parameters while retaining the relative spatial pattern obtained from the soils and vegetation data. Parameter multipliers were calibrated using the shuffled complex evolution algorithm [J. Optim. Theory Appl. 61 (1993)] with the objective to minimize the mean square error between observed and modeled hourly streamflows. We describe the model and calibrated results submitted for all basins for the time periods involved in the DMIP study. We were encouraged by the relatively good performance of the model, especially in comparison to streamflow from smaller interior watersheds not used in calibration and simulated as ungaged basins. The limited resources used to achieve these results show some of the potential for distributed models to be useful operationally. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Such a modelling approach has been widely used in operational hydrology, where the motivation is to produce as reliable as possible snowmelt discharge predictions for streamflow forecasting. There were meteorological and snow cover data available from a research site in southern Finland. Measurements included daily precipitation and air temperature records for the period extending from Dec 1, 1996 to Apr 30, 2000, and in the same period snow water equivalent was observed at approximately a weekly interval.

abstract = {Ice volume estimates are crucial for assessing water reserves stored in glaciers. Due to its large glacier coverage, such estimates are of particular interest for the Himalayan–Karakoram (HK) region. In this study, different existing methodologies are used to estimate the ice reserves: three area–volume relations, one slope-dependent volume estimation method, and two ice-thickness distribution models are applied to a recent, detailed, and complete glacier inventory of the HK region, spanning over the period 2000–2010 and revealing an ice coverage of 40 775 km2. An uncertainty and sensitivity assessment is performed to investigate the influence of the observed glacier area and important model parameters on the resulting total ice volume. Results of the two ice-thickness distribution models are validated with local ice-thickness measurements at six glaciers. The resulting ice volumes for the entire HK region range from 2955 to 4737 km3, depending on the approach. This range is lower than most previous estimates. Results from the ice thickness distribution models and the slope-dependent thickness estimations agree well with measured local ice thicknesses. However, total volume estimates from area-related relations are larger than those from other approaches. The study provides evidence on the significant effect of the selected method on results and underlines the importance of a careful and critical evaluation.},

abstract = {This paper provides the methodology and results of a cross-scale diagnostic performance assessment program of the irrigation water management in the old lands of the Nile Delta of Egypt. The analysis was done at three levels; main canal level, branch canals level and on-farm level of the Meet Yazid command (82,740 ha) for the year 2008-2009 to highlight areas for improvement. At the main canal level the annual average percentage of irrigation water returning to drains and groundwater was 53{\%} of the total water supplied. Since Meet Yazid lies at tail end of the delta, and there is groundwater salinity, opportunities for reuse are increasingly limited moving north to Lake Burullus. This would indicate opportunities for real water savings. The results of monthly relative water supply of the main canal indicated mismatch between demand and supply especially during the winter months, and when supply is low farmers do reuse drainage or groundwater. Also, the assessment of the three branch canals showed non-uniformity of water distribution and mismatch between demand and supply even when comparing improved and non-improved canals. At the on-farm level in paddy fields, the amount of irrigation flows to drains and saline sinks varied from 0.46 to 0.71 of inflow. In spite of these values of non-uniformity and low depleted fraction, the relative evapotranspiration (ratio of actual to potential) evaporation was uniformly high, indicating most crops of most farmers were not water stressed, which is also confirmed by the high yield values. The average values of productivity per unit water depleted by ET act were 1.04 and 1.05 kg/m 3 for rice and wheat fields, respectively, with yields of rice and wheat at 8 and 6 t per ha respectively. On farm and tertiary improvements alone will not yield real water savings, as excess water in the main canal and drains will continue to flow out of the system. Rather the focus should first be on supplies to the main canal, accompanied by more precise on farm and water delivery practices at branch and tertiary levels, and ensuring that environmental flows are met. There is an added advantage of focusing on this tail end region of Egypt that this response would lessen vulnerability to reuse of polluted and saline water.},

abstract = {Simulations with a hydrological model for the river Rhine for the present (1960-1989) and a projected future (2070-2099) climate are discussed. The hydrological model (RhineFlow) is driven by meteorological data from a 90-years (ensemble of three 30-years) simulation with the HadRM3H regional climate model for both present-day and future climate (A2 emission scenario). Simulation of present-day discharges is realistic provided that (1) the HadRM3H temperature and precipitation are corrected for biases, and (2) the potential evapotranspiration is derived from temperature only. Different methods are used to simulate discharges for the future climate: one is based on the direct model output of the future climate run (direct approach), while the other is based on perturbation of the present-day HadRM3H time series (delta approach). Both methods predict a similar response in the mean annual discharge, an increase of 30{\%} in winter and a decrease of 40{\%} in summer. However, predictions of extreme flows differ significantly, with increases of 10{\%} in flows with a return period of 100 years in the direct approach and approximately 30{\%} in the delta approach. A bootstrap method is used to estimate the uncertainties related to the sample size (number of years simulated) in predicting changes in extreme flows.},

abstract = {In many climate impact studies hydrological models are forced with meteorological data without an attempt to assess the quality of these data. The objective of this study was to compare downscaled ERA15 (ECMWF-reanalysis data) precipitation and temperature with observed precipitation and temperature and apply a bias correction to these forcing variables. Precipitation is corrected by fitting it to the mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of the observations. Temperature is corrected by fitting it to the mean and standard deviation of the observations. It appears that the uncorrected ERA15 is too warm and too wet for most of the Rhine basin. The bias correction leads to satisfactory results, precipitation and temperature differences decreased significantly, although there are a few years for which the correction of precipitation is less satisfying. Corrections were largest during summer for both precipitation and temperature. For precipitation alone large corrections were applied during September and October as well. Besides the statistics the correction method was intended to correct for, it is also found to improve the correlations for the fraction of wet days and lag-1 autocorrelations between ERA15 and the observations. For the validation period temperature is corrected very well, but for precipitation the RMSE of the daily difference between modeled and observed precipitation has increased for the corrected situation. When taking random years for calibration, and the remaining years for validation, the spread in the mean bias error (MBE) becomes larger for the corrected precipitation during validation, but the overal average MBE has decreased.},

We highlight the importance of C-band penetration for studies based on the SRTM elevation model. This penetration seems to be of potentially larger magnitude and variability than previously assumed. The most negative rate of region-wide glacier elevation change (−1) is observed for the eastern Nyainq{\^{e}}ntanglha Shan. Conversely, glaciers of the western Kunlun Shan are slightly gaining volume, and Pamir and Karakoram seem to be on the western edge of this mass-gain anomaly rather than its centre. For the Ganges, Indus and Brahmaputra basins, the glacier mass change reaches −24 ± 2 Gt yr−1, about 10{\%} of the current glacier contribution to sea-level rise. For selected catchments, we estimate glacier imbalance contributions to river run-off from a few percent to greater than 10{\%}.},

abstract = {In the design of water table management systems, the hydraulic capacity of the drain tubes and the outlet are usually assumed to be adequate to carry drainage and runoff from the fields and, thus, outlet limitations are not addressed. Unfortunately, some of the devices developed for closed control systems may sacrifice a portion of the outflow pipe area in the control mechanism and restrict the outflow rate. Three commercial outflow control devices were evaluated for outflow rate and were compared to a hypothetical flashboard riser system. Each of the devices restricts the flow by about 70{\%} as compared to the flashboard riser when the head is about 0.15 m (0.5 ft). However, at an area of about 0.45 ha (1.11 ac), the flow capacity of the 15 cm (6 in.) tubing will begin to limit the mainline outflow rates for the site and system conditions in the analysis. With proper design, currently-available, commercial flow-control devices will be of sufficient capacity and will not be a limiting factor in determining drainage system performance.},

abstract = {The boreal summer Asian monsoon has been evaluated in 25 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-5 (CMIP5) and 22 CMIP3 GCM simulations of the late 20th Century. Diagnostics and skill metrics have been calculated to assess the time-mean, climatological annual cycle, interannual variability, and intraseasonal variability. Progress has been made in modeling these aspects of the monsoon, though there is no single model that best represents all of these aspects of the monsoon. The CMIP5 multi-model mean (MMM) is more skillful than the CMIP3 MMM for all diagnostics in terms of the skill of simulating pattern correlations with respect to observations. Additionally, for rainfall/convection the MMM outperforms the individual models for the time mean, the interannual variability of the East Asian monsoon, and intraseasonal variability. The pattern correlation of the time (pentad) of monsoon peak and withdrawal is better simulated than that of monsoon onset. The onset of the monsoon over India is typically too late in the models. The extension of the monsoon over eastern China, Korea, and Japan is underestimated, while it is overestimated over the subtropical western/central Pacific Ocean. The anti-correlation between anomalies of all-India rainfall and Ni{\~{n}}o-3.4 sea surface temperature is overly strong in CMIP3 and typically too weak in CMIP5. For both the ENSO-monsoon teleconnection and the East Asian zonal wind-rainfall teleconnection, the MMM interannual rainfall anomalies are weak compared to observations. Though simulation of intraseasonal variability remains problematic, several models show improved skill at representing the northward propagation of convection and the development of the tilted band of convection that extends from India to the equatorial west Pacific. The MMM also well represents the space-time evolution of intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation anomalies. Caution is necessary when using GPCP and CMAP rainfall to validate (1) the time-mean rainfall, as there are systematic differences over ocean and land between these two data sets, and (2) the timing of monsoon withdrawal over India, where the smooth southward progression seen in India Meteorological Department data is better realized in CMAP data compared to GPCP data.},

abstract = {Hydrological processes within the terrestrial water cycle operate over a wide range of time and space scales, and with governing equations that may be a mixture of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper we propose a unified strategy for the formulation and solution of fully coupled process equations at the watershed and river basin scale. The strategy shows how a system of mixed equations can be locally reduced to ordinary differential equations using the semidiscrete finite volume method (FVM). Domain decomposition partitions the watershed surface onto an unstructured grid, and vertical projection of each element forms a finite volume on which all physical process equations are formed. The projected volume or prism is partitioned into surface and subsurface layers, leading to a fully coupled, local ODE system, referred to as the model ``kernel.'' The global ODE system is assembled by combining the local ODE system over the domain, and is then solved by a state-of-the-art ODE solver. The unstructured grid, based on Delaunay triangulation, is generated with constraints related to the river network, watershed boundary, elevation contours, vegetation, geology, etc. The underlying geometry and parameter fields are then projected onto the irregular network. The kernel-based formulation simplifies the process of adding or eliminating states, constitutive laws, or closure relations. The strategy is demonstrated for the Shale Hills experimental watershed in central Pennsylvania, and several phenomena are observed: (1) The enslaving principle is shown to be a useful approximation for soil moisture -- water table dynamics for shallow soils in upland watersheds; (2) the coupling shows how antecedent moisture (i.e., initial conditions) can amplify peak flows; (3) the coupled equations predict the onset or threshold for upland ephemeral channel flow; and (4) the model shows how microtopographic information controls surface saturation and connectivity of overland flow paths for the Shale Hills site. The open-source code developed in this research is referred to as the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM).},

One of these simulations is driven by the global atmospheric model HadAM3H of the UK Meteorological Office for the period 1961-1990 and the other by ERA40 re-analysis data. Much attention is given to the bias correction of RACMO precipitation. It was found that a relatively simple nonlinear correction adjusting both the biases in the mean and variability led to a better reproduction of observed extreme daily and multi-day precipitation amounts than the commonly used linear scaling correction. This also resulted in more realistic discharge extremes, suggesting that a correct representation of the variability of precipitation is important for the simulation of extreme flood quantiles. For the Meuse basin it is further shown that it is advantageous to correct for the variability of the 10-day precipitation amounts rather than that of the daily amounts. Despite the remaining biases in the RCM data, the simulated extreme flood quantiles correspond quite well with those obtained using observed precipitation and temperature. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Liang1996,
abstract = {HAPEX-MOBILHY data, consisting of one year of hourly atmospheric forcing data at Caumont (SAMER No. 3, 43.68°N, 0.1°W) were used repeatedly to run the two-layer Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC-2L) land-surface scheme until the model reached equilibrium in its water and energy balance. The equilibrium results are compared with one year of weekly soil moisture measurements at different depths, the estimated latent heat fluxes for 35 days of the intensive observation period (IOP), and the accumulated evaporation, runoff and drainage for the entire soya crop season. The latent heat flux comparisons show that VIC-2L tends to underestimate the evaporation due to the low soil moisture in its upper layer. The soil moisture comparison shows that the total soil water content is well simulated in general, but the soil water content in the top 0.5 m is underestimated, especially in May and June. These comparisons suggest that the lack of a mechanism for moving moisture from the lower to the upper soil layer in VIC-2L is the main cause for model error in the HAPEX-MOBILHY application. A modified version of VIC-2L, which has a new feature that allows diffusion of moisture between soil layers, and a 0.1 m thin layer on top of the previous upper layer, is described. In addition, the leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction vegetation cover are allowed to vary at each time step in a manner consistent with the rest PILPS-RICE Workshop, rather than being seasonally fixed. With these modifications, the VIC-2L simulations are re-evaluated. These changes are shown to resolve most of the structural deficiencies in the original version of the model. The sensitivity analysis of the new version of the model to the choices of soil depths and root distribution show that the evapotranspiration and soil moisture at the model equilibrium state are more sensitive to the root distribution than to the soil depth.},

@article{Downing2006,
abstract = {One of the major impediments to the integration of lentic ecosystems into global environmental analyses has been fragmentary data on the extent and size distribution of lakes, ponds, and impoundments. We use new data sources, enhanced spatial resolution, and new analytical approaches to provide new estimates of the global abundance of surface-water bodies. A global model based on the Pareto distribution shows that the global extent of natural lakes is twice as large as previously known (304 million lakes; {\$}4.2 million km{\^{}}2{\$} in area) and is dominated in area by millions of water bodies smaller than 1 km2. Similar analyses of impoundments based on inventories of large, engineered dams show that impounded waters cover approximately {\$}0.26 million km{\^{}}2{\$} . However, construction of low-tech farm impoundments is estimated to be between 0.1{\%} and 6{\%} of farm area worldwide, dependent upon precipitation, and represents {\$}{\textgreater}77,000 km{\^{}}2{\$} globally, at present. Overall, about {\$}4.6 million km{\^{}}2{\$} of the earth's continental "land" surface ({\textgreater}3{\%}) is covered by water. These analyses underscore the importance of explicitly considering lakes, ponds, and impoundments, especially small ones, in global analyses of rates and processes.},

abstract = {We present a technique for providing seasonal ensemble streamflow forecasts at several locations simultaneously on a river network. The framework is an integration of two recent approaches: the nonparametric multimodel ensemble forecast technique and the nonparametric space-time disaggregation technique. The four main components of the proposed framework are as follows: (1) an index gauge streamflow is constructed as the sum of flows at all the desired spatial locations; (2) potential predictors of the spring season (April{\&}{\#}8211;July) streamflow at this index gauge are identified from the large-scale ocean-atmosphere-land system, including snow water equivalent; (3) the multimodel ensemble forecast approach is used to generate the ensemble flow forecast at the index gauge; and (4) the ensembles are disaggregated using a nonparametric space-time disaggregation technique resulting in forecast ensembles at the desired locations and for all the months within the season. We demonstrate the utility of this technique in skillful forecast of spring seasonal streamflows at four locations in the Upper Colorado River Basin at different lead times. Where applicable, we compare the forecasts to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center's Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) and the National Resource Conservation Service {\&}{\#}8220;coordinated{\&}{\#}8221; forecast, which is a combination of the ESP, Statistical Water Supply, a principal component regression technique, and modeler knowledge. We find that overall, the proposed method is equally skillful to existing operational models while tending to better predict wet years. The forecasts from this approach can be a valuable input for efficient planning and management of water resources in the basin.},

abstract = {This study presents various aspects of the continuous simulation capabilities of a fully-distributed, triangulated irregular network (TIN) hydrologic model. The TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS) is calibrated and verified for the Baron Fork at Eldon, Illinois River at Watts, and Blue River at Blue over the period 1993-2000. Computational effort is significantly reduced by simulating complex watersheds using a multiple resolution mesh to represent terrain. Model performance is assessed by comparing streamflow predictions to observations at the basin outlet and interior gauging stations. In addition, simulation results describing the distributed basin response to atmospheric forcing are discussed, including the spatial and temporal variability of runoff, surface soil moisture, evaporative flux, and groundwater table position. By modeling the land-surface water and energy states and fluxes over the computational domain in an efficient manner, the potential for utilizing fully-distributed models at the scales of operational hydrologic forecasting is realized. Through the spatially-explicit approach, high-resolution remote sensing data describing surface properties, topography, rainfall, and soil moisture can be integrated directly into a predictive hydrologic model. A greater degree of physical interpretation of hydrological estimation can thus be added to existing methods of operational forecasting. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper introduces and presents the Spatial Processes in HYdrology (SPHY) model (v2.0), its development background, its underlying concepts, and some example applications. SPHY has been developed with the explicit aim of simulating terrestrial hydrology on flexible scales, under various physiographical and hydroclimatic conditions, by integrating key components from existing and well-tested models. SPHY is a spatially distributed leaky bucket type of model, and is applied on a cell-by-cell basis. The model is written in the Python programming language using the PCRaster dynamic modeling framework. SPHY (i) integrates most hydrologic processes, (ii) has the flexibility to be applied in a wide range of hydrologic applications, and (iii) on various scales, and (iv) can easily be implemented. The most relevant hydrological processes that are integrated into the SPHY model are rainfall–runoff processes, cryosphere processes, evapotranspiration processes, the dynamic evolution of vegetation cover, lake/reservoir outflow, and the simulation of root-zone moisture contents. Studies in which the SPHY model was successfully applied and tested are described in this paper, including (i) real-time soil moisture predictions to support irrigation management in lowland areas, (ii) climate change impact studies in snow- and glacier-fed river basins, and (iii) operational flow forecasting in mountainous catchments.},

abstract = {The “satellite-gauge-model” (SGM) technique is described for combining precipitation estimates from microwave satellite data, infrared satellite data, rain gauge analyses, and numerical weather prediction models into improved estimates of global precipitation. Throughout, monthly estimates on a 2.5° × 2.5° lat-long grid are employed. First, a multisatellite product is developed using a combination of low-orbit microwave and geosynchronous-orbit infrared data in the latitude range 40°N–40–S (the adjusted geosynchronous precipitation index) and low-orbit microwave data alone at higher latitudes. Then the rain gauge analysis is brought in, weighting each field by its inverse relative error variance to produce a nearly global, observationally based precipitation estimate. To produce a complete global estimate, the numerical model results are used to fill data voids in the combined satellite-gauge estimate. Our sequential approach to combining estimates allows a user to select the multisatellite estimate, the satellite-gauge estimate, or the full SGM estimate (observationally based estimates plus the model information). The primary limitation in the method is imperfections in the estimation of relative error for the individual fields. The SGM results for one year of data (July 1987 to June 1988) show important differences from the individual estimates, including model estimates as well as climatological estimates. In general, the SGM results are drier in the subtropics than the model and climatological results, reflecting the relatively dry microwave estimates that dominate the SGM in oceanic regions},

abstract = {The Indian subcontinent faces a population increase from 1.6billion in 2000 towards 2billion around 2050. Therefore, expansion of agricultural area combined with increases in productivity will be necessary to produce the food needed in the future. However, with pressure on water resources already being high, and potential effects of climate change still uncertain, the question rises whether there will be enough water resources available to sustain this production. The objective of this study is to make a spatially explicit quantitative analysis of water requirements and availability for current and future food production in five South Asian basins (Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Godavari and Krishna), in the absence or presence of two different adaptation strategies: an overall improvement in irrigation efficiency, and an increase of reservoir storage capacity. The analysis is performed by using the coupled hydrology and crop production model LPJmL. It is found that the Godavari and Krishna basins will benefit most from an increased storage capacity, whereas in the Ganges and the Indus water scarcity mainly takes place in areas where this additional storage would not provide additional utility. Increasing the irrigation efficiency will be beneficial in all basins, but most in the Indus and Ganges, as it decreases the pressure on groundwater resources and decreases the fraction of food production that would become at risk because of water shortage. A combination of both options seems to be the best strategy in all basins. The large-scale model used in this study is suitable to identify hotspot areas and support the first step in the policy process, but the final design and implementation of adaptation options requires supporting studies at finer scales.},

abstract = {The impact of climate change on the hydrology of the Chute-du-Diable watershed (Quebec, Canada) is studied by comparing statistics on current and projected future discharge resulting from a wide range of climate change scenarios. The use of 10 equally weighted climate projections from a combination of 5 general circulation models (GCMs) and 2 greenhouse gas emission scenarios (GHGES) allows for the definition of an uncertainty envelope of future hydrologic variables. GCM data is downscaled using the change factor approach for 30-year time slices centered around years 2020, 2050 and 2080. To estimate natural variability, synthetic time series are then computed for each horizon and for each climate change scenario, using a stochastic weather generator (30 series of 30 years), and are entered into a hydrology model. Future hydrological regimes are then compared to the control period (1961-1990) using the annual and seasonal mean discharge, peak discharge and timing of peak discharge criteria. Results indicate a 1-14 °C increase in seasonal temperature and a -9 to +55{\%} change in seasonal precipitation. The largest increases in both temperature and precipitation are observed in the winter and spring seasons. The main hydrologic impact observed is a spring flood appearing 1-5 weeks earlier than usual and a modification of its amplitude from -40 to +25{\%}. Most scenarios suggest increases in the winter, spring and fall discharge, whereas summer is expected to see a decrease in discharge. While there is still a large scatter in projected values, the uncertainty analysis projects a better view of the most probable future hydrologic behaviour of the watershed. Of all sources of uncertainty considered in this study, the largest comes from the choice of a GCM. Accordingly, all impact studies based on results from only one GCM should be interpreted with caution. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) regional climate model version 3 (ICTP-RegCM3) multiyear simulations of East Africa rainfall during the October–December, short rains season are evaluated. Two parallel runs; based on NCEP reanalysis and NASA FvGCM lateral boundary conditions are performed. The simulated monthly and seasonal rainfall climatology as well as the interannual variability are found to be fairly consistent with the observations. The model climatology over specific homogeneous climate subregions, except central Kenya (CKE) highlands, also reasonably agrees with the observed. The latitude-time evolution (intraseasonal variability) of the simulated seasonal rainfall exhibits two distinct modes of behavior. The first is a quasistationary mode associated with high rainfall throughout the season within the equatorial belt between 1°S and 2°N. The second mode is associated with the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)-driven southward migration of regions of rainfall maxima as the season progresses, which is also consistent with the observed. Furthermore, observed rainfall variability over distinct homogeneous climate subregions is also fairly reproduced by the model, except over central Kenya highlands and northeastern parts of Kenya. The spatial correlation between the simulated seasonal rainfall and some of the global teleconnections (DMI and Nino3.4 indices) shows that the regional model conserves some of the observed regional ‘hot spots' where rainfall-ENSO/DMI associations are strong. At the same time, unlike observations, the model reveals that along the East Africa Rift Valley and over western parts of the Lake Victoria Basin, the association is weak, perhaps an indication that nonlinear interactions between local forcing (captured by the model) and large-scale systems either suppress or obscur the dominant influence of the teleconnections on rainfall over certain parts.

abstract = {ABSTRACT. The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) is a globally complete collection of digital outlines of glaciers, excluding the ice sheets, developed to meet the needs of the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for estimates of past and future mass balance. The RGI was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the 198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999–2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 80034 000km2. The uncertainty, about 5{\%}, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to sea-level rise.},

However, this information is not readily available at field level for larger irrigation areas. An innovative inverse modeling approach was tested for a field in an irrigation scheme in southern Spain where observed actual evapotranspiration by satellites was used to assess irrigation application amounts. The actual evapotranspiration was used as the basis for an optimization procedure using the physical based SWAP model and the parameter optimization tool PEST. To evaluate the proposed techniques two steps were taken. First, actual observed evapotranspiration from remote sensing was used to optimize two parameters of the SWAP model to determine irrigation applications. Second, a forward-backward approach was applied to test the minimum overpass return time of satellites and the required accuracy of remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration for accurate assessment of irrigation applications. Results indicate that irrigation application amounts can be estimated reasonably accurately, providing data are available at an interval of 15 days or shorter and the accuracy of the signal is 90{\%} or higher. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {After a programme of integrated field and modelling research, hydrological processes of considerable uncertainty such as snow redistribution by wind, snow interception, sublimation, snowmelt, infiltration into frozen soils, hillslope water movement over permafrost, actual evaporation, and radiation exchange to complex surfaces have been described using physically based algorithms. The cold regions hydrological model (CRHM) platform, a flexible object-oriented modelling system was devised to incorporate these algorithms and others and to connect them for purposes of simulating the cold regions hydrological cycle over small to medium sized basins. Landscape elements in CRHM can be linked episodically in process-specific cascades via blowing snow transport, overland flow, organic layer subsurface flow, mineral interflow, groundwater flow, and streamflow. CRHM has a simple user interface but no provision for calibration; parameters and model structure are selected based on the understanding of the hydrological system; as such the model can be used both for prediction and for diagnosis of the adequacy of hydrological understanding. The model is described and demonstrated in basins from the semi-arid prairie to boreal forest, mountain and muskeg regions of Canada where traditional hydrological models have great difficulty in describing hydrological phenomena. Some success is shown in simulating various elements of the hydrological cycle without calibration; this is encouraging for predicting hydrology in ungauged basins.

@article{Liu2007,
abstract = {With population growth and economic development, the agricultural sector is facing the challenge to produce more food with less water. Crop water productivity (CWP) is important for understanding water–food relationships. It also provides a basis for the assessment of water use efficiency embodied in global food trade. However, traditional methods are not sufficient for estimating CWP on a global scale considering large spatial and temporal variations across different geographical locations. In this paper, a GIS-based EPIC model (GEPIC) is developed and tested to estimate wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and CWP at a grid resolution of 300 on the land surface. A comparison between simulated yields and FAO statistical yields in 102 countries over 10 years shows a good agreement. The simulated CWP is also mostly in line with the CWP reported in the literature. The simulation results show that compared with rainfed wheat, irrigated wheat has higher frequencies for high CWP ({\textgreater}0.8 kg m 3) and lower frequencies for low CWP ({\textless}0.8 kg m 3). This is likely because irrigation can provide timely water supply to crop development and the management of irrigated crops is usually more intensive than in rainfed production. A strong linear relation is found between CWP and yield. High wheat yield and CWP appear in the European countries, especially those in western and northern Europe. Low wheat yield and CWP are seen in most African countries. The simulation using GEPIC, however, shows that wheat yield and CWP in many African countries could increase substantially with sufficient water supply and fertilizer application. Variations in CWP across countries suggest that global water use could be reduced through food trade. Calculations indicate a saving of 77 {\textperiodcentered}109 m3 of water in 2000 through international wheat trade as a result of relatively high CWP in major exporting countries. However, the simulation results also suggest that an overall improvement in CWP through better crop management practices in local areas could make a greater contribution to the reduction in global water use.},

abstract = {The sediment fluxes of the Moulouya and the Sebou Rivers – the two largest rivers in Morocco – were estimated on the basis of suspended sediment loads carried by these rivers towards the coastal zone. The high rate of the specific sediment yield of the Sebou (995 t km–2 year–1), which is one of the highest in Africa, is probably due to the fact that the drainage basin is characterized by young mountains, extended erodible sedimentary rocks, irregular and often stormy precipitation and scarce vegetation. Recently, the construction of dams and changes in rainfall have drastically reduced these sediment load and water discharges. It is estimated that the construction of dams has reduced the water discharge of the Sebou and the Moulouya rivers by 70 and 47{\%} respectively, and their sediment fluxes by nearly 95 and 93{\%}. The damming of rivers has also had a profound effect on the coastal zones, which reacted by reaching a new sedimentary equilibrium. The forcing induced by the estuarine behavior of the lower stretches of both rivers downstream of the dams has greatly disturbed the mouth topography and coastal stability.},

abstract = {This study investigates likely changes in mean and extreme precipitation over southern Africa in response to changes in radiative forcing using an ensemble of global climate models prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Extreme seasonal precipitation is defined in terms of 10-yr return levels obtained by inverting a generalized Pareto distribution fitted to excesses above a predefined high threshold. Both present (control) and future climate precipitation extremes are estimated. The future-to-control climate ratio of 10-yr return levels is then used as an indicator for the likely changes in extreme seasonal precipitation. A Bayesian approach to multimodel ensembling is adopted. The relative weights assigned to each of the model simulations is determined from bias, convergence, and correlation. Using this method, the probable limits of the changes in mean and extreme precipitation are estimated from their posterior distribution. Over the western parts of southern Africa, an increase in the severity of dry extremes parallels a statistically significant decrease in mean precipitation during austral summer months. A notable delay in the onset of the rainy season is found in almost the entire region. An early cessation is found in many parts. This implies a statistically significant shortening of the rainy season. A substantial reduction in moisture influx from the southwestern Indian Ocean during austral spring is projected. This and the preaustral spring moisture deficits are possible mechanisms delaying the rainfall onset in southern Africa. A possible offshore (northeasterly) shift of the tropical–temperate cloud band is consistent with more severe droughts in the southwest of southern Africa and enhanced precipitation farther north in Zambia, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. This study shows that changes in the mean vary on relatively small spatial scales in southern Africa and differ between seasons. Changes in extremes often, but not always, parallel changes in the mean precipitation.},

abstract = {Six statistical and two dynamical downscaling models were compared with regard to their ability to downscale seven seasonal indices of heavy precipitation for two station networks in northwest and southeast England. The skill among the eight downscaling models was high for those indices and seasons that had greater spatial coherence. Generally, winter showed the highest downscaling skill and summer the lowest. The rainfall indices that were indicative of rainfall occurrence were better modelled than those indicative of intensity. Models based on non-linear artificial neural networks were found to be the best at modelling the inter-annual variability of the indices; however, their strong negative biases implied a tendency to underestimate extremes. A novel approach used in one of the neural network models to output the rainfall probability and the gamma distribution scale and shape parameters for each day meant that resampling methods could be used to circumvent the underestimation of extremes. Six of the models were applied to the Hadley Centre global circulation model HadAM3P forced by emissions according to two SRES scenarios. This revealed that the inter-model differences between the future changes in the downscaled precipitation indices were at least as large as the differences between the emission scenarios for a single model. This implies caution when interpreting the output from a single model or a single type of model (e.g. regional climate models) and the advantage of including as many different types of downscaling models, global models and emission scenarios as possible when developing climate-change projections at the local scale.},

abstract = {Nutrient discharge to coastal waters from rivers draining populated areas can cause vast algal blooms. Changing conditions in the drainage basin, like land use change, or climate induced changes in hydrology, may alter riverine nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fluxes and further increase the pressure on coastal water quality. Several large scale models have been employed to quantify riverine nutrient fluxes on a yearly to decadal timescale. Seasonal variation of these fluxes, governed by internal nutrient transformations and attenuation, is often larger than the inter-annual variation and may contain crucial information on nutrient transfer through river basins and should therefore not be overlooked. In the last decade the increasing availability of global datasets at fine resolutions has enabled the modelling of multiple basins using a coherent dataset. Furthermore, the use of global datasets will aid to global change impact assessment. We developed a new model, RiNUX, to adequately simulate present and future river nutrient loads in large river basins. The RiNUX model captures the intra-annual variation at the basin scale in order to provide more accurate estimates of future nutrient loads in response to global change. With an incorporated dynamic sediment flux model, the particulate nutrient loads can be assessed. It is concluded that the RiNUX model provides a powerful, spatial and temporal explicit tool to estimate intra-annual variations in riverine nutrient loads in large river basins. The model was calibrated using the detailed RHIN dataset and its overall efficiency was tested using a coarser dataset GLOB for the Rhine basin. Using the RHIN dataset seasonal variable nutrient load at the river outlet can be satisfactorily modelled for both total N (E = 0.50) and total P (E = 0.47). The largest prediction errors occur in estimating high TN loads. When using the GLOB dataset, the model efficiency is lower for TN (E = 0.12), due to overestimated nutrient emissions. For TP, the model efficiency is only slightly lower (E = 0.36) in comparison to the RHIN dataset. Despite the lower model efficiencies for the GLOB dataset, we conclude that this dataset provided reasonably good estimates of seasonal nutrient loads in the Rhine basin and is considered promising for application to other, less documented, large river basins. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {With the increasing scarcity of water and the need for real water saving measures, a clear understanding of the productivity of water is essential. For a basin in western Turkey, simulation modeling was performed at three different scales (field, irrigation scheme, and basin level) to obtain all terms of the water balance. These water balances were used to calculate the Productivity of Water (PW) at the three levels. Four PW indices were considered: PWirrigated (yield / irrigation), PWinflow (yield / net inflow), PWdepleted (yield / depletion), and PWprocess (yield / process depletion), all expressed in kg yield per m3 water. Two cotton fields were considered at the field scale and it was found that the more upstream field performed better than the field at the tail-end since runoff from the upstream field was used by downstream users and was not considered as a loss. At the irrigation scheme level PWirrigated was higher than at the individual cotton field level, since non-irrigated crops were also included. Other PW values were lower as crops more sensitive to drought were also found in the irrigated areas. Basin scale PWs were lower than those at the irrigation scheme, as large areas of the basin were covered with less productive land types. This study demonstrates that the PW indices provide quantitative measures of water dynamics. Models provide a useful methodology for extending field observation for the estimation of the indicators.},

It has four broad steps: (1) Principal component analysis is performed on the spatial streamflows to identify the dominant modes of variability. (2) Potential predictors of the dominant streamflow modes are identified from several large-scale climate features and snow water equivalent information. (3) Objective criterion is used to select a suite of candidate nonlinear regression models each with different predictors. (4) Ensemble forecasts of the dominant streamflow modes are generated from the candidate models and are combined objectively to produce a multimodel ensemble, which are then back transformed to produce spatially coherent streamflow forecasts at all the locations. The utility of the framework is demonstrated in the skillful forecast of spring seasonal streamflows at six locations in the Gunnison River Basin at several lead times. The generated ensemble streamflow forecast provides valuable and useful information for optimal management and planning of water resources in the basin.},

abstract = {More than half of the solar energy absorbed by land surfaces is currently used to evaporate water. Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land−a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability−remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network, meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm. In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using an ensemble of process-based land-surface models. Our results suggest that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 ± 1.0 millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that, coincident with the last major El Ni{\~{n}}o event in 1998, the global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the applicability and utility of watershed hydrologic models in different hydro-geologic and soil conditions is necessary for a range of spatial scales and to assess the utility of these models as watershed water resources management tools. This study presents the application of the hydrological model TOPNET to the Big Darby Creek watershed, Ohio, United States. It focuses on the simulation modeling of stream flow in the watershed based on meteorological data for the eight year period of 1992-1999. Visual comparison of time series plots and statistical measures namely, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), coefficient of correlation (R(2)), and the percent bias (PBIAS) were used to assess the model performance. The statistical model evaluation results indicated that the model has a relatively high confidence and can give a good representation of the flow hydrographs for the watershed. For the calibration period simulations of annual stream flow were accurate with a mean R(2) and NS of 86{\%} and 85{\%} for the Big Darby at Darbyville gaging station. For the little Darby at West Jefferson gaging station a mean R(2) of 81{\%} was obtained while the NS averaged 78{\%}. Further analysis based on the aggregation of the water years into wet seasons and dry seasons, the model was also able to adequately simulate stream flow for both gaging stations and for both low flow periods and high flow periods. Statistical analysis for the validation period also yielded high R(2) values of 88{\%} and 83{\%} for the Darby at Big Darby at Darbyville gaging station and Little Darby at West Jefferson gaging station respectively. The worst PBIAS obtained for both calibration and validation period was 18{\%} and this is better than recommended values for satisfactory daily simulations of +/- 25{\%} for PBIAS. The encouraging simulation results obtained in this study shows the utility and usefulness of the TOPNET model in hydrological modeling and ultimately as a water resources management tool.},

abstract = {Surface digital elevation models (DEMs) and slope-related estimates of glacier thickness enable modelling of glacier-bed topographies over large ice-covered areas. Due to the erosive power of glaciers, such bed topographies can contain numerous overdeepenings, which when exposed following glacier retreat may fill with water and form new lakes. In this study, the bed overdeepenings for {\~{}}28 000 glaciers (40 775 km 2 ) of the Himalaya-Karakoram region are modelled using GlabTop2 (Glacier Bed Topography model version 2), in which ice thickness is inferred from surface slope by parameterizing basal shear stress as a function of elevation range for each glacier. The modelled ice thicknesses are uncertain (±30{\%}), but spatial patterns of ice thickness and bed elevation primarily depend on surface slopes as derived from the DEM and, hence, are more robust. About 16 000 overdeepenings larger than 10 4 m 2 were detected in the modelled glacier beds, covering an area of {\~{}}2200 km 2 and having a volume of {\~{}}120km 3 (3-4{\%} of present-day glacier volume). About 5000 of these overdeepenings (1800 km 2 ) have a volume larger than 10 6 m 3 . The results presented here are useful for anticipating landscape evolution and potential future lake formation with associated opportunities (tourism, hydropower) and risks (lake outbursts).},

@article{Hurkmans_2009,
abstract = {The hydrological regime of the Rhine basin is expected to shift from a combined snowmelt-rainfall regime to a more rainfall-dominated regime because of climate change, leading to more extreme flood peaks and low flows. Land use changes may reinforce the effects of this shift through urbanization or may counteract them through, for example, afforestation. In this study, we investigate the effect of projected land use change scenarios on river discharge. Sensitivity of mean and extreme discharge in the Rhine basin to land use changes is investigated at various spatial scales. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) (version 4.0.5) model is used for hydrological modeling forced by a high-resolution atmospheric data set spanning the period 1993–2003. The model is modified to allow for bare soil evaporation and canopy evapotranspiration simultaneously in sparsely vegetated areas, as this is more appropriate for simulating seasonal effects. All projected land use change scenarios lead to an increase in streamflow. The magnitude of the increase, however, varies among subbasins of different scales from about 2{\%} in the upstream part of the Rhine (about 60,000 km2) to about 30{\%} in the Lahn basin (about 7000 km2). Streamflow at the basin outlet proved rather insensitive to land use changes because over the entire basin affected areas are relatively small. Moreover, projected land use changes (urbanization and conversion of cropland into (semi)natural land or forest) have opposite effects. At smaller scales, however, the effects can be considerable.},

abstract = {For approximately 20 years, there has been a concerted effort, by several different research groups, to simulate observed rainfall-runoff events from the well-known R-5 catchment, located near Chickasha, Oklahoma. These prior simulation efforts, with relatively simple models of Horton-type overland flow, have not been entirely successful, as the streamflow generation process for the R-5 catchment, as now recognized, may not be totally dominated by the Horton mechanism. In the effort reported here, a new fully coupled comprehensive physics-based hydrologic-response model, the Integrated Hydrology Model (InHM), is tested for two R-5 rainfall-runoff events. The InHM simulations in this study clearly show, in a hypothesis-testing mode, that both the Horton and Dunne overland flow mechanisms can be important streamflow generation processes for R-5 events. The InHM simulations reported here also suggest that accurate accounting of soil water storage can be as important as exhaustive characterization of spatial variations in near-surface permeability. -Surface Runoff},

abstract = {Mountain ranges in Asia are important water suppliers, especially if downstream climates are arid, water demands are high and glaciers are abundant. In such basins, the hydrological cycle depends heavily on high-altitude precipitation. Yet direct observations of high-altitude precipitation are lacking and satellite derived products are of insufficient resolution and quality to capture spatial variation and magnitude of mountain precipitation. Here we use glacier mass balances to inversely infer the high-altitude precipitation in the upper Indus basin and show that the amount of precipitation required to sustain the observed mass balances of large glacier systems is far beyond what is observed at valley stations or estimated by gridded precipitation products. An independent validation with observed river flow confirms that the water balance can indeed only be closed when the high-altitude precipitation on average is more than twice as high and in extreme cases up to a factor of 10 higher than previously thought. We conclude that these findings alter the present understanding of high-altitude hydrology and will have an important bearing on climate change impact studies, planning and design of hydropower plants and irrigation reservoirs as well as the regional geopolitical situation in general.},

abstract = {This paper reviews observed (1900-2000) and possible future (2000-2100) continentwide changes in temperature and rainfall for Africa. For the historic period we draw upon a new observed global climate data set which allows us to explore aspects of regional climate change related to diurnal temperature range and rainfall variability. The latter includes an investigation of regions where seasonal rainfall is sensitive to El Ni{\~{n}}o climate variability. This review of past climate change provides the context for our scenarios of future greenhouse gas-induced climate change in Africa. These scenarios draw upon the draft emissions scenarios prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Third Assessment Report, a suite of recent global climate model experiments, and a simple climate model to link these 2 sets of analyses. We present a range of 4 climate futures for Africa, focusing on changes in both continental and regional seasonal-mean temperature and rainfall. Estimates of associated changes in global CO2 concentration and global-mean sea-level change are also supplied. These scenarios draw upon some of the most recent climate modelling work. We also identify some fundamental limitations to knowledge with regard to future African climate. These include the often poor representation of El Ni{\~{n}}o climate variability in global climate models, and the absence in these models of any representation of regional changes in land cover and dust and biomass aerosol loadings. These omitted processes may well have important consequences for future African climates, especially at regional scales. We conclude by discussing the value of the sort of climate change scenarios presented here and how best they should be used in national and regional vulnerability and adaptation assessments.},

The study area includes seven operational basins of varying size and location in the southeastern United States. The analysis indicates that agreements between the datasets vary considerably from basin to basin and also temporally within the basins. The analysis also includes evaluation of MAPS in comparison with MAPG for use in flow forecasting with a lumped hydrologic model [Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA)]. The latter evaluation investigates two different parameter sets, the first obtained using manual calibration on historical MAPG, and the second obtained using automatic calibration on both MAPS and MAPG, but over a shorter time period (23 months). Results indicate that the overall performance of the model simulations using MAPS depends on both the bias in the precipitation estimates and the size of the basins, with poorer performance in basins of smaller size (large bias between MAPG and MAPS) and better performance in larger basins (less bias between MAPG and MAPS). When using MAPS, calibration of the parameters significantly improved the model performance.},

Less certain is the extent to which meteorological processes at individual sites will be affected. So-called ‘downscaling' techniques are used to bridge the spatial and temporal resolution gaps between what climate modellers are currently able to provide and what impact assessors require. This paper describes a decision support tool for assessing local climate change impacts using a robust statistical downscaling technique. Statistical DownScaling Model (sdsm) facilitates the rapid development of multiple, low-cost, single-site scenarios of daily surface weather variables under current and future regional climate forcing. Additionally, the software performs ancillary tasks of predictor variable pre-screening, model calibration, basic diagnostic testing, statistical analyses and graphing of climate data. The application of sdsm is demonstrated with respect to the generation of daily temperature and precipitation scenarios for Toronto, Canada by 2040–2069.},

A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a "climate-smart food system" that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.},

High-resolution temperature and precipitation fields derived from gridded station data, and bias-corrected with independent station observations, are used to drive the historical model from 1961 to 2007. The model is calibrated against geodetically derived estimates of net glacier mass change from 1992 to 2008, termini position of four large glaciers at the end of the calibration period, average velocities observed on selected debris-covered glaciers, and total glacierized area. We integrate field-based observations of glacier mass balance and ice thickness with remotely sensed observations of decadal glacier change to validate the model. Between 1961 and 2007, the mean modelled volume change over the Dudh Koshi basin is −6.4 ± 1.5 km3, a decrease of 15.6{\%} from the original estimated ice volume in 1961. Modelled glacier area change between 1961 and 2007 is −101.0 ± 11.4 km2, a decrease of approximately 20{\%} from the initial extent. The modelled glacier sensitivity to future climate change is high. Application of temperature and precipitation anomalies from warm/dry and wet/cold end-members of the CMIP5 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 ensemble results in sustained mass loss from glaciers in the Everest region through the 21st century.},

abstract = {A range of different statistical downscaling models was calibrated using both observed and general circulation model (GCM) generated daily precipitation time series and intercompared. The GCM used was the U.K. Meteorological Office, Hadley Centre's coupled ocean/atmosphere model (HadCM2) forced by combined CO2 and sulfate aerosol changes. Climate model results for 1980–1999 (present) and 2080–2099 (future) were used, for six regions across the United States. The downscaling methods compared were different weather generator techniques (the standard “WGEN” method, and a method based on spell-length durations), two different methods using grid point vorticity data as an atmospheric predictor variable (B-Circ and C-Circ), and two variations of an artificial neural network (ANN) transfer function technique using circulation data and circulation plus temperature data as predictor variables. Comparisons of results were facilitated by using standard sets of observed and GCM-derived predictor variables and by using a standard suite of diagnostic statistics. Significant differences in the level of skill were found among the downscaling methods. The weather generation techniques, which are able to fit a number of daily precipitation statistics exactly, yielded the smallest differences between observed and simulated daily precipitation. The ANN methods performed poorly because of a failure to simulate wet-day occurrence statistics adequately. Changes in precipitation between the present and future scenarios produced by the statistical downscaling methods were generally smaller than those produced directly by the GCM. Changes in daily precipitation produced by the GCM between 1980–1999 and 2080–2099 were therefore judged not to be due primarily to changes in atmospheric circulation. In the light of these results and detailed model comparisons, suggestions for future research and model refinements are presented},

The mechanisms that govern tropical North Africa climate are diagnosed from NCEP reanalysis data in the period 1958–1998: spatially – using composite and correlation analysis, and temporally – using wavelet co-spectral analysis. The Sahelian climate is characterised by a decadal rhythm, whilst the mountainous eastern and equatorial regions exhibit interannual cycles. ENSO-modulated zonal circulations over the Atlantic/Pacific sector are important for decadal variations, and create a climatic polarity between South America and tropical North Africa as revealed through upper-level velocity potential and convection patterns. A more localised N–S shift in convection between the Sahel and Guinea coast is associated with the African Easterly Jet.},

abstract = {The present study aims at evaluating and comparing precipitation over the Amazon in two sets of historical and future climate simulations based on phase 3 (CMIP3) and 5 (CMIP5) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Thirteen models have been selected in order to discuss (1) potential improvements in the simulation of present-day climate and (2) the potential reduction in the uncertainties of the model response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. While several features of present-day precipitation—including annual cycle, spatial distribution and co variability with tropical sea surface temperature (SST)—have been improved, strong uncertainties remain in the climate projections. A closer comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP3 highlights a weaker consensus on increased precipitation during the wet season, but a stronger consensus on a drying and lengthening of the dry season. The latter response is related to a northward shift of the boreal summer intertropical convergence zone in CMIP5, in line with a more asymmetric warming between the northern and southern hemispheres. The large uncertainties that persist in the rainfall response arise from contrasted anomalies in both moisture convergence and evapotranspiration. They might be related to the diverse response of tropical SST and ENSO (El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation) variability, as well as to spurious behaviours among the models that show the most extreme response. Model improvements of present-day climate do not necessarily translate into more reliable projections and further efforts are needed for constraining the pattern of the SST response and the soil moisture feedback in global climate scenarios.},

In West Africa rainfall has been subject to largedecadal and interdecadal variations during the 20th century. The most prominent feature is thereduction in rainfall amount throughout the second half of the century with somerecovery at the end. Among the conceivable mechanisms, which might inducesuch low-frequency variability in West African precipitation, this study isfocussed onsea surface temperature (SST) variations and increasing greenhouse gas (GHG)concentrations. A tool is presented to distinguish between both impacts bymeans of various climate model simulations, which are found to reproduce theobserved rainfall characteristics over West Africa reasonably well.Further, a multi-model approach is usedto evaluate the expected future greenhouse signal in West African rainfall with respect to natural variability and intermodel variations.It is found that observed SST fluctuations, forcing two different atmospheric climate models, are able to reproduce the main features ofobserved decadal rainfall anomalies in the southern part of West Africathroughout the second half of the 20th century. The seasonal response to varying SST isstrongest in summer when the region is undergoing intensive monsoondynamics. Whereas both atmospheric models simulate the observeddrought tendency,following the 1960s, there is some indication that the additional GHG forcing in one model inducessome significantly different rainfall anomalies in recent years, re-initiatingeven positive anomalies relative to the climatological mean which has alsobeen observed since the 1990s. However, thisresult is still subject to model uncertainty.Coupled climate model integrations with different climate change scenariosalsopredict that precipitation, particularly over the Guinea Coast and Sahelregion, will steadily increase into the 21st century. The model-comprehensive signal isstatistically significant with respect to natural variability and modeluncertainty, suggesting that the observed recovery of yearly rainfall overparts of West Africa might actually reflect the beginning impact of risinganthropogenic GHG. The physical mechanism, linking the radiative forcing tothe monsoonal rainfall, probably works via warming of the tropicalAtlantic Ocean.},

An operating rule was determined for each reservoir using a newly-developed algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capacity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. This algorithm reduced the root mean square error of reservoir release and river discharge simulations from that of earlier global river discharge simulations that neglected reservoir operations or substituted an algorithm for natural-lake outflow. The 2-year global simulation results indicate that reservoir operations substantially altered monthly discharge for individual basins (i.e., by more than 20{\%}). Averaged over the continental scale, the maximum change in monthly river discharge varied from 0{\%} to 34{\%} and the changes in reservoir storage were small as a proportion of the total storage capacity. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A climate-driven hydrology and water resources model was calibrated using meteorological and streamflow observations and later forced by a baseline and two climate change projections (A2, B2) that show an increase in temperature of about 3–4°C and a reduction in precipitation of 10–30{\%} with respect to baseline. The results show that annual mean streamflow decreases more than the projected rainfall decrease because a warmer climate also enhances water losses to evapotranspiration. Also in future climate, the seasonal maximum streamflow tends to occur earlier than in current conditions, because of the increase in temperature during spring/summer and the lower snow accumulation in winter.},

abstract = {Variations of Australian-average mean temperature and diurnal temperature range over the twentieth century are investigated. The observed interannual variability of both is simulated reasonably well by a number of climate models, but they do not simulate the observed relationship between the two. Comparison of the observed warming and reduction in diurnal temperature range with climate model simulations shows that Australian temperature changes over the twentieth century were very unlikely to be due to natural climate variations alone. It is likely that there has been a significant contribution to the observed warming during the second half of the century from increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols.},

Data were obtained from ten existing sources, screened for coding errors, and redundant station records were removed. The edited data base contains 24,635 spatially independent terrestrial station records and 2223 oceanic grid-point records. A procedure for correcting gauge-induced biases is presented and used to remove systematic errors caused by wind, wetting on the interior walls of the gauge, and evaporation from the gauge. These ‘corrected' monthly precipitation observations were then interpolated to a 0{\textperiodcentered}5° of latitude by 0{\textperiodcentered}5° of longitude grid using a spherically based interpolation procedure. Bias-corrected spatial distributions of the annual mean and intraannual variance are presented along with a harmonic decomposition of the intra-annual variance.},

abstract = {Distributed hydrologic models are increasingly used to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of water fluxes and state variables occurring within a basin. Reliable model simulations at multiple scales and locations, however, can be obtained only if a robust parameterization method is employed. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three parameterization methods: two based on the hydrological response units (HRUs) and one on the multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique. They were implemented into the distributed mesoscale hydrologic model and then applied to 45 southern German basins. A set of numerical experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the transferability of free parameters to scales and locations other than those used during calibration. The performance of all three methods was comparable for daily discharge simulations when their free parameters were calibrated independently in each basin at a given scale. A significant deterioration in performance of HRU was, however, noticed when free parameters calibrated at coarser scales were shifted to finer ones (up to 60{\%}), whereas MPR exhibited quasi scale-invariant performance with losses in modeling efficiency of less than 2{\%}. Moreover, the latter preserves the spatiotemporal pattern of the simulated variables at a given scale, when transferred from other scales. Evaluation of the transferability of free parameters to ungauged locations further indicated the higher effectiveness and reliability of MPR compared with those of HRU. This study emphasizes the importance of a robust parameterization method in distributed hydrologic modeling.},

abstract = {The objective is to assess the suitability of commonly used high-resolution satellite rainfall products (CMORPH, TMPA 3B42RT, TMPA 3B42 and PERSIANN) as input to the semi-distributed hydrological model SWAT for daily streamflow simulation in two watersheds (Koga at 299 km2 and Gilgel Abay at 1656 km2) of the Ethiopian highlands. First, the model is calibrated for each watershed with respect to each rainfall product input for the period 2003–2004. Then daily streamflow simulations for the validation period 2006–2007 are made from SWAT using rainfall input from each source and corresponding model parameters; comparison of the simulations to the observed streamflow at the outlet of each watershed forms the basis for the conclusions of this study. Results reveal that the utility of satellite rainfall products as input to SWAT for daily streamflow simulation strongly depends on the product type. The 3B42RT and CMORPH simulations show consistent and modest skills in their simulations but underestimate the large flood peaks, while the 3B42 and PERSIANN simulations have inconsistent performance with poor or no skills. Not only are the microwave-based algorithms (3B42RT, CMORPH) better than the infrared-based algorithm (PERSIANN), but the infrared-based algorithm PERSIANN also has poor or no skills for streamflow simulations. The satellite-only product (3B42RT) performs much better than the satellite-gauge product (3B42), indicating that the algorithm used to incorporate rain gauge information with the goal of improving the accuracy of the satellite rainfall products is actually making the products worse, pointing to problems in the algorithm. The effect of watershed area on the suitability of satellite rainfall products for streamflow simulation also depends on the rainfall product. Increasing the watershed area from 299 km2 to 1656 km2 improves the simulations obtained from the 3B42RT and CMORPH (i.e. products that are more reliable and consistent) rainfall inputs while it deteriorates the simulations obtained from the 3B42 and PERSIANN (i.e. products that are unstable and inconsistent) rainfall inputs.},

abstract = {An innovative approach is developed and presented to assess historical climate variations and to quantify future climate change for the entire Brahmaputra basin. Historical trends in temperature and precipitation are analysed from 1900 to 2002 for the Tibetan plateau (TP), the Himalayan belt and the floodplains (FP) using a global 100 year monthly high resolution dataset. Temperature patterns are consistent with global warming and out of the 10{\%} warmest years from 1900 to 2002 six occurred between 1995 and 2002. No clear trends in precipitation were found and annual precipitation in the basin is mainly determined by the strength of the monsoon. Regression analysis is used to further explain monsoon precipitation. A significant inverse relation is found between air temperature differences between the FP and the TP and the strength of the monsoon, whereas the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation teleconnection does not have a prominent role in explaining variation in monsoon precipitation. Simulation results of six general circulation models are statistically downscaled to the spatial resolution of the observed dataset for two future storylines. The analysis predicts accelerated seasonal increases in both temperature and precipitation from 2000 to 2100. The largest changes occur on the TP and the smallest on the FP. Multiple regression analysis shows a sharp increase in the occurrence of average and extreme downstream discharges for both storylines. The strongest increases are projected for the monsoon season and the largest threat of climate change lies in the associated flooding in the densely populated FP.},

On the basis of a theoretically founded modelling protocol, the different steps in distributed hydrological modelling are illustrated through a case study based on the MIKE SHE code and the 440 km2 Karup catchment in Denmark. The importance of a rigorous and purposeful parameterisation is emphasized in order to get as few 'free' parameters as possible for which assessments through calibration are required. Calibration and validation using a split-sample procedure were carried out for catchment discharge and piezometric heads at seven selected observation wells. The validated model was then used for two further validation tests. Firstly, model simulations were compared with observations from three additional discharge sites and four additional wells located within the catchment. This internal validation showed significantly poorer results compared to the calibration/validation sites. Secondly, the validated model based on a 500 m model grid was used to generate three additional models with 1000 m, 2000 m and 4000 m grids through interpolation of model parameters. The results from the multi-scale validation suggested that a maximum grid size of 1000 m should be used for simulations of discharge and ground-water heads, while the results deteriorated with coarser model grids.},

abstract = {The physically based distributed modelling system, MIKE SHE, is used to simulate the hydrological water balance of a small watershed with the objective of developing the irrigation plan. Simulation is first conducted over 109 days, concentrating the attention on the main cropping season, i.e., kharif (Jul-Oct), and the average water balance is calculated. It is observed that in spite of the frequent rainfall in the season, there are phases when the water content in the root zone goes below the allowable deficit. In case irrigation is not supplied during these periods, the yield of the paddy will only be about 70{\%} of the potential yield. To attain the potential yield, the irrigation requirement is calculated as 490 and 340 mm for the upstream and downstream ends of the watershed respectively. Irrigation schedule for the purpose is suggested. Hydrological water balance simulation is further extended to the second cropping season, i.e., rabi (Nov-Feb), over 100-day period. Here, the water stored in the existing tank at the outlet is used for the supplemental irrigation in the season. It is seen that the actual yields obtained are very close to the potential yields of the selected crops. The results overall illustrate the applicability of a comprehensive hydrological modelling system for the management of water resources for agricultural purposes in a watershed.},

abstract = {The respective merits of statistical and regional modeling techniques for downscaling GCM predictions have been evaluated over New Zealand, a small mountainous country surrounded by ocean. The boundary conditions were supplied from twice-daily European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses at 2.5° resolution for the period 1980–94, which were taken as the output of a “perfect” climate model. Daily and monthly estimates of minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation from both techniques were validated against readings from a network of 78 climate stations. The statistical estimates were made by a screening regression technique using the EOFs of the regional height fields at 1000 and 500 hPa, and local variables derived from these fields, as predictors. The model interpolations made use of the RAMS model developed at Colorado State University running at 50-km resolution for 1990–94 only. The model values at the nearest grid point to each station were rescaled using a simple linear regression to give the best fit to the station values. The results show both methods to have comparable skill in estimating daily and monthly station anomalies of temperatures and rainfall. Statistical estimates of monthly departures were better obtained directly from monthly mean forcing than from a combination of daily estimates; however, daily values are needed if one wishes to estimate variability. While there are good physical grounds for using the modeling technique to estimate the likely effects of climate change, the statistical technique requires considerably less computational effort and may be preferred for many applications.},

Existing models exhibit deficiencies such as overparameterization, the lack of an effective technique to integrate the spatial heterogeneity of physiographic characteristics, and the nontransferability of parameters across scales and locations. A multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique is proposed as a way to address these issues simultaneously. Using this technique, parameters at a coarser scale, in which the dominant hydrological processes are represented, are linked with their corresponding ones at a finer resolution in which input data sets are available. The linkage is done with upscaling operators such as the harmonic mean, among others. Parameters at the finer scale are regionalized through nonlinear transfer functions which link basin predictors with global parameters to be determined through calibration. MPR was compared with a standard regionalization (SR) method in which basin predictors instead of model parameters are first aggregated. Both methods were tested in a basin located in Germany using a distributed hydrologic model. Results indicate that MPR is superior to SR in many respects, especially if global parameters are transferred from coarser to finer scales. Furthermore, MPR, as opposed to SR, preserves the spatial variability of state variables and conserves the mass balance with respect to a control scale. Cross-validation tests indicate that the transferability of the global parameters to ungauged locations is possible.},

@article{Rigon2006,
abstract = {This paper describes a new distributed hydrological model, called GEOtop. The model accommodates very complex topography and, besides the water balance, unlike most other hydrological models, integrates all the terms in the surface energy balance equation. GEOtop uses a discretization of the landscape based on digital elevation data. These digital elevation data are preprocessed to allow modeling of the effect of topography on the radiation incident on the surface, both shortwave (including shadowing) and longwave (accounting for the sky view factor). For saturated and unsaturated subsurface flow, GEOtop makes use of a numerical solution of the 3D Richards' equation in order to properly model, besides the lateral flow, the vertical structure of water content and the suction dynamics. These characteristics are deemed necessary for consistently modeling hillslope processes, initiation of landslides, snowmelt processes, and ecohydrological phenomena as well as discharges during floods and interstorm periods. An accurate treatment of radiation inputs is implemented in order to be able to return surface temperature. The motivation behind the model is to combine the strengths and overcome the weaknesses of flood forecasting and land surface models. The former often include detailed spatial description and lateral fluxes but usually lack appropriate knowledge of the vertical ones. The latter are focused on vertical structure and usually lack spatial structure and prediction of lateral fluxes. Outlines of the processes simulated and the methods used to simulate them are given. A series of applications of the model to the Little Washita basin of Oklahoma using data from the Southern Great Plains 1997 Hydrology Experiment (SGP97) is presented. These show the model's ability to reproduce the pointwise energy and water balance, showing that just an elementary calibration of a few parameters is needed for an acceptable reproduction of discharge at the outlet, for the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil moisture content, and for the simulation of a full year's streamflow without additional calibration.},

abstract = {A statistical bias correction methodology for global climate simulations is developed and applied to daily land precipitation and mean, minimum and maximum daily land temperatures. The bias correction is based on a fitted histogram equalization function. This function is defined daily, as opposed to earlier published versions in which they were derived yearly or seasonally at best, while conserving properties of robustness and eliminating unrealistic jumps at seasonal or monthly transitions. The methodology is tested using the newly available global dataset of observed hydrological forcing data of the last 50. years from the EU project WATCH (WATer and global CHange) and an initial conditions ensemble of simulations performed with the ECHAM5 global climate model for the same period. Bias corrections are derived from 1960 to 1969 observed and simulated data and then applied to 1990-1999 simulations. Results confirm the effectiveness of the methodology for all tested variables. Bias corrections are also derived using three other non-overlapping decades from 1970 to 1999 and all members of the ECHAM5 initial conditions ensemble. A methodology is proposed to use the resulting "ensemble of bias corrections" to quantify the error in simulated scenario projections of components of the hydrological cycle. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This article presents a method for spatial assessment of drought risk in Bangladesh. A conceptual framework, which emphasizes the combined role of hazard and vulnerability in defining risk, is used for the study. Standardized precipitation index method in a GIS environment is used to map the spatial extents of drought hazards in different time steps. The key social and physical factors that define drought vulnerability in the context of Bangladesh are identified and corresponding thematic maps in district level are prepared. Composite drought vulnerability map is developed through the integration of those thematic maps. The risk is computed as the product of the hazard and vulnerability. The result shows that droughts pose highest risk to the northern and northwestern districts of Bangladesh.},

abstract = {Human activities exert global-scale impacts on our environment with significant implications for freshwater-driven services and hazards for humans and nature. Our approach to the science of hydrology needs to significantly change so that we can understand and predict these implications. Such an adjustment is a necessary prerequisite for the development of sustainable water resource management strategies and to achieve long-term water security for people and the environment. Hydrology requires a paradigm shift in which predictions of system behavior that are beyond the range of previously observed variability or that result from significant alterations of physical (structural) system characteristics become the new norm. To achieve this shift, hydrologists must become both synthesists, observing and analyzing the system as a holistic entity, and analysts, understanding the functioning of individual system components, while operating firmly within a well-designed hypothesis testing framework. Cross-disciplinary integration must become a primary characteristic of hydrologic research, catalyzing new research and nurturing new educational models. The test of our quantitative understanding across atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere will necessarily lie in new approaches to benchmark our ability to predict the regional hydrologic and connected implications of environmental change. To address these challenges and to serve as a catalyst to bring about the necessary changes to hydrologic science, we call for a long-term initiative to address the regional implications of environmental change.},

@article{Kalnay_1996,
abstract = {The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted “reanalysis”) to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957–96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a “quick look” CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CD-ROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Re-analysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, “C” variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957–96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data.

abstract = {Various remote sensing products are used to identify spatial-temporal trends in snow cover in river basins originating in the Himalayas and adjacent Tibetan-Qinghai plateau. It is shown that remote sensing allows detection of spatial-temporal patterns of snow cover across large areas in inaccessible terrain, providing useful information on a critical component of the hydrological cycle. Results show large variation in snow cover between years while an increasing trend from west to east is observed. Of all river basins the Indus basin is, for its water resources, most dependent on snow and ice melt and large parts are snow covered for prolonged periods of the year. A significant negative winter snow cover trend was identified for the upper Indus basin. For this basin a hydrological model is used and forced with remotely sensed derived precipitation and snow cover. The model is calibrated using daily discharges from 2000 to 2005 and stream flow in the upper Indus basin can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. From the analysis it is concluded that there are indications that regional warming is affecting the hydrology of the upper Indus basin due to accelerated glacial melting during the simulation period. This warming may be associated with global changes in air temperature resulting from anthropogenic forcings. This conclusion is primarily based on the observation that the average annual precipitation over a five year period is less than the observed stream flow and supported by positive temperature trends in all seasons. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This new dataset, which the authors have named the CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), contains precipitation distributions with full global coverage and improved quality compared to the individual data sources. Examinations showed no discontinuity during the 17-yr period, despite the different data sources used for the different subperiods. Comparisons of the CMAP with the merged analysis of Huffman et al. revealed remarkable agreements over the global land areas and over tropical and subtropical oceanic areas, with differences observed over extratropical oceanic areas. The 17-yr CMAP dataset is used to investigate the annual and interannual variability in large-scale precipitation. The mean distribution and the annual cycle in the 17-yr dataset exhibit reasonable agreement with existing long-term means except over the eastern tropical Pacific. The interannual variability associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation phenomenon resembles that found in previous studies, but with substantial additional details, particularly over the oceans. With complete global coverage, extended period and improved quality, the 17-yr dataset of the CMAP provides very useful information for climate analysis, numerical model validation, hydrological research, and many other applications. Further work is under way to improve the quality, extend the temporal coverage, and to refine the resolution of the merged analysis.},

A prediction system of seasonal (winter and summer) discharge is evaluated using 1) predictions of the average North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index for the coming winter based on May SST anomalies of the North Atlantic; 2) a global-scale hydrological model; and 3) 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. The skill of seasonal discharge predictions is investigated with a numerical experiment. Also Europe-wide patterns of predictive skill are related to the use of NAO-based seasonal weather prediction, the hydrological properties of the river basin, and a correct assessment of initial hydrological states. These patterns, which are also corroborated by observations, show that in many parts of Europe the skill of predicting winter discharge can, in theory, be quite large.

The precipitation data are compared spatially and temporally in two forms: (1) precipitation magnitudes, and (2) resulting streamflow and water storages. Simulated streamflow is assessed using historical monthly discharge data from in situ stream gauges and recent stage data based on water surface elevations derived from ENVISAT radar altimetry data. Simulated total water storage is assessed using monthly storage change values derived from GRACE data. The results show that the three precipitation datasets vary significantly in terms of magnitudes but generally produce a reasonable hydrograph throughout much of the basin, with the exception of the equatorial regions of the watershed. The satellite datasets provide unreasonably high values for specific periods (e.g. all three in Oct–Nov; only CMORPH and PERSIANN in Mar–Apr) in the equatorial regions. Overall, TRMM (3B42) provides the best spatial and temporal distributions and magnitudes or rainfall based on the assessment measures used here. Both CMORPH and PERSIANN tend to overestimate magnitudes, especially in the equatorial regions of the Basin.},

abstract = {The problems of identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure remain outstanding research challenges for the discipline of hydrology. Progress on these problems requires understanding of the nature of differences between models. This paper presents a methodology to diagnose differences in hydrological model structures: the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE). FUSE was used to construct 79 unique model structures by combining components of 4 existing hydrological models. These new models were used to simulate streamflow in two of the basins used in the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX): the Guadalupe River (Texas) and the French Broad River (North Carolina). Results show that the new models produced simulations of streamflow that were at least as good as the simulations produced by the models that participated in the MOPEX experiment. Our initial application of the FUSE method for the Guadalupe River exposed relationships between model structure and model performance, suggesting that the choice of model structure is just as important as the choice of model parameters. However, further work is needed to evaluate model simulations using multiple criteria to diagnose the relative importance of model structural differences in various climate regimes and to assess the amount of independent information in each of the models. This work will be crucial to both identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure. To facilitate research on these problems, the FORTRAN-90 source code for FUSE is available upon request from the lead author.},

The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.},

abstract = {Data scarcity has traditionally precluded the application of advanced hydrologic techniques in developing countries. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a flood forecasting scheme in a sparsely monitored catchment based on distributed hydrologic modeling, discharge assimilation, and numerical weather predictions with explicit validation uncertainty analysis. For the hydrologic component of our framework, we apply TopNet to the Cautin River basin, located in southern Chile, using a fully distributed a priori parameterization based on both literature-suggested values and data gathered during field campaigns. Results obtained from this step indicate that the incremental effort spent in measuring directly a set of model parameters was insufficient to represent adequately the most relevant hydrologic processes related to spatiotemporal runoff patterns. Subsequent uncertainty validation performed over a six month ensemble simulation shows that streamflow uncertainty is better represented during flood events, due to both the increase of state perturbation introduced by rainfall and the flood-oriented calibration strategy adopted here. Results from different assimilation configurations suggest that the upper part of the basin is the major source of uncertainty in hydrologic process representation and hint at the usefulness of interpreting assimilation results in terms of model input and parameterization inadequacy. Furthermore, in this case study the violation of Markovian state properties by the Ensemble Kalman filter did affect the numerical results, showing that an explicit treatment of the time delay between the generation of surface runoff and the arrival at the basin outlet is required in the assimilation scheme. Peak flow forecasting results demonstrate that there is a major problem with the Weather Research and Forecasting model outputs, which systematically overestimate precipitation over the catchment. A final analysis performed for a large flooding event that occurred in July 2006 shows that, in the absence of bias introduced by an incorrect model calibration, the updating of both model states and meteorological forecasts contributes to a better representation of streamflow uncertainty and to better hydrologic forecasts.},

A necessary step in assessing the potential and utility of these products is to quantify the uncertainty associated with them at validation scales appropriate for hydrological applications. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of the widely-known PERSIANN-CCS high-resolution (hourly, 0.04° × 0.04°) satellite rainfall products against high-quality NEXRAD radar rainfall observations in the Little Washita watershed. Our results reveal that (1) PERSIANN-CCS shows high skills in reproducing the patterns of inter-annual rainfall variability on a monthly basis; (2) both at the hourly and storm scales, the performance statistics of PERSIANN-CCS exhibit large spread, suggesting that the quality of PERSIANN-CCS product is almost unique for each hour and storm; and (3) significant improvement in performance statistics is obtained as PERSIANN-CCS products are averaged to longer sub-daily time scales. The implications of our results are: (1) PERSIANN-CCS could be used with high confidence for inter-annual rainfall variability studies; (2) PERSIANN-CCS products need to be accompanied by corresponding hourly error estimates in order to provide meaningful error estimates for hydrological applications; and (3) research is needed to characterize the tradeoff between the quality of rainfall input and the space-time resolution of hydrological modeling, as a function of watershed size and hydrologic model complexity level.},

The LSM lower boundary is often assumed zero flux or the soil moisture content is set to a constant value; an approach that while mass conservative, ignores processes that can alter surface fluxes, runoff, and water quantity and quality. Conversely, groundwater models (GWMs) for saturated and unsaturated water flow, while addressing important features such as subsurface heterogeneity and three-dimensional flow, often have overly simplified upper boundary conditions that ignore soil heating, runoff, snow, and root-zone uptake.

The recalibration technique is model output statistics (MOS) using principal components regression (PCR) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to statistically link archived records of the GCM to regional rainfall over much of Africa, south of the equator. The predictability of anomalously dry and wet conditions over each rainfall region during December–February (DJF) using the linear statistical model and MOS models has been quantitatively evaluated. The MOS technique outperforms the raw-GCM ensembles and the linear statistical model. Neither the PCR-MOS nor the CCA-MOS models show clear superiority over the other, probably because the two methods are closely related.

abstract = {Physically based hydrological models describe natural processes more accurately than conceptual models but require extensive data sets to produce accurate results. To identify the value of different data sets for improving the performance of the distributed hydrological model TOPKAPI we combine a multivariable validation technique with Monte Carlo simulations. The study is carried out in the snow and ice-dominated Rhonegletscher basin, as these types of mountainous basins are generally the most critical with respect to data availability and sensitivity to climate fluctuations. Each observational data set is used individually and in combination with the other data sets to determine a subset of best parameter combinations out of 10,000 Monte Carlos runs performed with randomly generated parameter sets. We validate model results against discharge, glacier mass balance, and satellite snow cover images for a 14 year time period (1994{\&}8211;2007). While the use of all data sets combined provides the best overall model performance (defined by the concurrent best agreement of simulated discharge, snow cover and mass balance with their respective measurements), the use of one or two variables for constraining the model results in poorer performance. Using only one data set for constraining the model glacier mass balance proved to be the most efficient observation leading to the best overall model performance. Our main result is that a combination of discharge and satellite snow cover images is best for improving model performance, since the volumetric information of discharge data and the spatial information of snow cover images are complementary.},

abstract = {Glacierised river catchments have been shown to be highly sensitive to climate change, while large populations depend on the water resources originating from them. Hydrological models are used to aid water resource management, yet their treatment of glacier processes is either rudimentary in large applications or linked to fully distributed glacier models that prevent larger model domains. Also, data scarcity in mountainous catchments has hampered the implementation of physically based approaches over entire river catchments. A fully integrated glacier dynamics module was developed for the eco-hydrological model SWIM (SWIM-G) that takes full account of the spatial heterogeneity of mountainous catchments but keeps in line with the semi-distributed disaggregation of the hydrological model. The glacierised part of the catchment is disaggregated into glaciological response units that are based on subbasin, elevation zone and aspect classes. They seamlessly integrate into the hydrological response units of the hydrological model SWIM. Robust and simple approaches to ice flow, avalanching, snow accumulation and metamorphism as well as glacier ablation under consideration of aspect, debris cover and sublimation are implemented in the model, balancing process complexity and data availability. The fully integrated is also capable of simulating a range of other hydrological processes that are common for larger mountainous catchments such as reservoirs, irrigation agriculture and runoff from a diverse soil and vegetation cover. SWIM-G is initialised and calibrated to initial glacier hypsometry, glacier mass balance and river discharge. While the model is intended to be used in medium to large river basins with data-scarce and glacierised headwaters, it is here validated in the data-abundant catchment of the Upper Rhone River, Switzerland and the data-scarce catchment of the Upper Aksu River, Kyrgyzstan/NW China.},

The functions have regular derivatives of all orders everywhere. This makes them suitable for analysis of surface geometry and for direct application in models where derivatives are necessary. For processing of large datasets (thousands of data points), which are now common in geosciences, a segmentation algorithm with a flexible size of overlapping neighborhood is presented. Simple examples demonstrating flexibility and accuracy of the functions are presented.},

abstract = {Data scarcity has traditionally precluded the application of advanced hydrologic techniques in developing countries. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a flood forecasting scheme in a sparsely monitored catchment based on distributed hydrologic modeling, discharge assimilation, and numerical weather predictions with explicit validation uncertainty analysis. For the hydrologic component of our framework, we apply TopNet to the Cautin River basin, located in southern Chile, using a fully distributed a priori parameterization based on both literature-suggested values and data gathered during field campaigns. Results obtained from this step indicate that the incremental effort spent in measuring directly a set of model parameters was insufficient to represent adequately the most relevant hydrologic processes related to spatiotemporal runoff patterns. Subsequent uncertainty validation performed over a six month ensemble simulation shows that streamflow uncertainty is better represented during flood events, due to both the increase of state perturbation introduced by rainfall and the flood-oriented calibration strategy adopted here. Results from different assimilation configurations suggest that the upper part of the basin is the major source of uncertainty in hydrologic process representation and hint at the usefulness of interpreting assimilation results in terms of model input and parameterization inadequacy. Furthermore, in this case study the violation of Markovian state properties by the Ensemble Kalman filter did affect the numerical results, showing that an explicit treatment of the time delay between the generation of surface runoff and the arrival at the basin outlet is required in the assimilation scheme. Peak flow forecasting results demonstrate that there is a major problem with the Weather Research and Forecasting model outputs, which systematically overestimate precipitation over the catchment. A final analysis performed for a large flooding event that occurred in July 2006 shows that, in the absence of bias introduced by an incorrect model calibration, the updating of both model states and meteorological forecasts contributes to a better representation of streamflow uncertainty and to better hydrologic forecasts.},

abstract = {An assessment is made of downscaling estimates of screen temperature and precipitation observed at 976 European stations during 1983–94. A statistical downscaling technique, in which local values are inferred from observed atmospheric predictor variables, is compared against two dynamical downscaling techniques, based on the use of the screen temperature or precipitation simulated at the nearest grid point in integrations of two climate models. In one integration a global general circulation model (GCM) is constrained to reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation over the period of interest, while the second involves a high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) nested inside the GCM.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nThe dynamical and statistical methods are compared in terms of the correlation between the estimated and observed time series of monthly anomalies. For estimates of temperature a high degree of skill is found, especially over western, central, and northern Europe; for precipitation skill is lower (average correlations ranging from 0.4 in summer to 0.7 in winter). Overall, the dynamical and statistical methods show similar levels of skill, although the statistical method is better for summertime estimates of temperature while the dynamical methods give slightly better estimates of wintertime precipitation. In general, therefore, the skill with which present-day surface climate anomalies can be derived from atmospheric observations is not improved by using the sophisticated calculations of subgrid-scale processes made in climate models rather than simple empirical relationships. It does not necessarily follow that statistical and dynamical downscaling estimates of changes in surface climate will also possess equal skill.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nBy the above measure the two dynamical techniques possess approximately equal skill; however, they are also compared by assessing errors in the mean and variance of monthly values and errors in the simulated distributions of daily values. Such errors arise from systematic biases in the models plus the effect of unresolved local forcings. For precipitation the results show that the RCM offers clear benefits relative to the GCM: the simulated variability of both daily and monthly values, although lower than observed, is much more realistic than in the GCM because the finer grid reduces the amount of spatial smoothing implicit in the use of grid-box variables. The climatological means are also simulated better in the winter half of the year because the RCM captures some of the mesoscale detail present in observed distributions. The temperature fields contain a mesoscale orographic signal that is skillfully reproduced by the RCM; however, this is not a source of increased skill relative to the GCM since elevation biases can be largely removed using simple empirical corrections based on spatially averaged lapse rates. Nevertheless, the average skill of downscaled climatological mean temperature values is higher in the RCM in nearly all months. The additional skill arises from better resolution of local physiographical features, especially coastlines, and also from the dynamical effects of higher resolution, which generally act to reduce the large-scale systematic biases in the simulated values. Both models tend to overestimate the variability of both daily and monthly mean temperature. On average the RCM is more skillful in winter but less skillful in summer, due to excessive drying of the soil over central and southern Europe.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nThe downscaling scores for monthly means are compared against scores obtained by using a predictor variable consisting of observations from the nearest station to the predictand station. In general the downscaling scores are significantly worse than those obtained from adjacent stations, indicating that there remains considerable scope for refining the techniques in future. In the case of dynamical downscaling progress can be made by reducing systematic errors through improvements in the representation of physical processes and increased resolution; the prospects for improving statistical downscaling will depend on the availability of the observational data needed to provide longer calibration time series and/or a wider range of predictor variables.},

In this study, the authors first calibrated Ts and Ms models [Forest Soil Temperature Model (ForSTeM) and Forest Hydrology Model (ForHyM), respectively] using long-term observations of Ts and Ms at different depths measured at three forest sites in eastern Canada. The two models were then used to project Ts and Ms for the period 1971-2100 using historical and future climate scenarios generated by one regional and five global climate models. Results indicate good model performance by ForSTeM and ForHyM in predicting observed Ts and Ms values at various depths for the three sites. Projected annual-mean Ts at these sites increased between 1.1 degree and 1.9 degree C and between 1.9 degree and 3.3 degree C from the present 30-yr averages (1971-2000) to the periods 2040-69 and 2070-99, respectively. Increases as high as 5.0 degree C were projected at the black spruce site during the growing season (June) for the period 2070-99. Changes in annual-mean Ms were relatively small; however, seasonally Ms is projected to increase in April, because of earlier snowmelt, and to decrease during the growing season, mainly because of higher evapotranspiration rates. Soil moisture in the growing season could be reduced by 20{\%}-40{\%} for the period 2070-99 compared to the reference period. The projected warmer and drier soil conditions in the growing season could have significant impacts on forests growth and biogeochemical cycles.},

abstract = {Regional or local climate change modeling studies currently require starting with a global climate model, then downscaling to the region of interest. How should global models be chosen for such studies, and what effect do such choices have? This question is addressed in the context of a regional climate detection and attribution (D{\&}A) study of January-February-March (JFM) temperature over the western U.S. Models are often selected for a regional D{\&}A analysis based on the quality of the simulated regional climate. Accordingly, 42 performance metrics based on seasonal temperature and precipitation, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are constructed and applied to 21 global models. However, no strong relationship is found between the score of the models on the metrics and results of the D{\&}A analysis. Instead, the importance of having ensembles of runs with enough realizations to reduce the effects of natural internal climate variability is emphasized. Also, the superiority of the multimodel ensemble average (MM) to any 1 individual model, already found in global studies examining the mean climate, is true in this regional study that includes measures of variability as well. Evidence is shown that this superiority is largely caused by the cancellation of offsetting errors in the individual global models. Results with both the MM and models picked randomly confirm the original D{\&}A results of anthropogenically forced JFM temperature changes in the western U.S. Future projections of temperature do not depend on model performance until the 2080s, after which the better performing models show warmer temperatures.},

abstract = {The area burned by forest fires in Canada has increased over the past four decades, at the same time as summer season temperatures have warmed. Here we use output from a coupled climate model to demonstrate that human emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosol have made a detectable contribution to this warming. We further show that human-induced climate change has had a detectable influence on the area burned by forest fire in Canada over recent decades. This increase in area burned is likely to have important implications for terrestrial emissions of carbon dioxide and for forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {We analyze ensembles (four realizations) of historical and future climate transient experiments carried out with the coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, version HADCM2, with four scenarios of greenhouse gas (GHG) and sulfate forcing. The analysis focuses on the regional scale, and in particular on 21 regions covering all land areas in the World (except Antarctica). We examine seasonally averaged surface air temperature and precipitation for the historical period of 1961-1990 and the future climate period of 2046-2075. Compared to previous AOGCM simulations, the HADCM2 model shows a good performance in reproducing observed regional averages of summer and winter temperature and precipitation. The model, however, does not reproduce well observed interannual variability. We find that the uncertainty in regional climate change predictions associated with the spread of different realizations in an ensemble (i.e. the uncertainty related to the internal model variability) is relatively low for all scenarios and regions. In particular, this uncertainty is lower than the uncertainty due to inter-scenario variability and (by comparison with previous regional analyses of AOGCMs) with inter-model variability. The climate biases and sensitivities found for different realizations of the same ensemble were similar to the corresponding ensemble averages and the averages associated with individual realizations of the same ensemble did not differ from each other at the 5{\%} confidence level in the vast majority of cases. These results indicate that a relatively small number of realizations (3 or 4) is sufficient to characterize an AOGCM transient climate change prediction at the regional scale.},

abstract = {Given its rapid urbanization, the Canagagigue Creek watershed, located in Ontario, Canada's Grand River Basin, is subjected to shifting hydrological patterns. For the region's sustainable development, planning efforts must be based on a sound understanding of its hydrological behaviour. Thus, surface runoff was simulated using a watershed-scale model MIKE SHE. The model was calibrated with four years of data (1994-95 to 1997-98) and validated with a further four years (1990-91 to 1993-94) of data. Satisfactory levels of correlation (R2) were obtained between monitored and model-simulated daily runoff: 0.59 and 0.44 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. Similar values of 0.59 and 0.40, respectively, were obtained for the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient. For the winter/spring period, model performance was adversely affected by its dependence on daily input data and a simplistic snowmelt routine. However, overall, the model was able to simulate surface runoff reasonably well on an annual, seasonal, monthly, or daily interval, representing all the hydrological components adequately. It was concluded that the model could be used to investigate shifts in hydrological behaviour of the watershed.},

Field experiments, satellite images and geographical data were processed into input data for 10 uniform simulation areas. As simulated mean annual drainage water (312 mm) of the entire area was only 14{\%} smaller than measured (356 mm), its distribution over the drainage units was well reproduced, and simulated and measured groundwater levels agreed well. Currently, water management leads to excessive irrigation (621–1436 mm year−1), and leaching as well as high salinity of shallow groundwater are responsible for large amounts of drainage water (25–59{\%}) and salts (44–752 mg cm−2). Focused water management can decrease mean drainage water (22–48{\%}) and salts (30–49{\%}), compared with current water management without adverse effects on relative transpiration and root zone salinity.},

abstract = {Uncertainty in spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in regional crop yield simulations comprises a major fraction of the error on crop model simulation results. In this paper we used an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate coarse resolution satellite microwave sensor derived soil moisture estimates (SWI) for correcting errors in the water balance of the world food studies (WOFOST) crop model. Crop model simulations with the EnKF for winter wheat and grain maize were carried out for Spain, France, Italy and Germany for the period 1992–2000. The results were evaluated on the basis of regression with known crop yield statistics at national and regional level. Moreover, the EnKF filter innovations were analysed to see if any systematic trends could be found that could indicate deficiencies in the WOFOST water balance. Our results demonstrate that the assimilation of SWI has clearly improved the relationship with crop yield statistics for winter wheat for the majority of regions (66{\%}) where a relationship could be established. For grain maize the improvement is less evident because improved relationships could only be found for 56{\%} of the regions. We suspect that partial crop irrigation could explain the relatively poor results for grain maize, because irrigation is not included in the model. Analyses of the filter innovations revealed spatial and temporal patterns, while the distribution of normalised innovations is not Gaussian and has a non-zero mean indicating that the EnKF performs suboptimal. The non-zero mean is caused by differences in the mean value of the forecasted and observed soil moisture climatology, while the excessive spread in the distribution of normalised innovations indicates that the error covariances of forecasts and observations have been underestimated. These results clearly indicate that additional sources of error need to be included in the simulations and observations.},

The predictors are snow water equivalent (SWE) and 500 mbar geopotential height and sea surface temperature (SST) ‘‘indices'' developed in this study. We use local regression methods to provide ensemble (probabilistic) forecasts. Results show that the incorporation of climate information, particularly the 500 mbar geopotential height index, improves the skills of forecasts at longer lead times when compared with forecasts based on snowpack information alone. The technique is general and could be used to incorporate large-scale climate information into ensemble streamflow forecasts for other river basins. Citation:},

With a spatial resolution of 5 arc min (about 9.2 km at the equator), MIRCA2000 provides both irrigated and rainfed crop areas of 26 crop classes for each month of the year. The data set covers all major food crops as well as cotton. Other crops are grouped into categories (perennial, annual, and fodder grasses). It represents multicropping systems and maximizes consistency with census-based national and subnational statistics. According to MIRCA2000, 25{\%} of the global harvested areas are irrigated, with a cropping intensity (including fallow land) of 1.12, as compared to 0.84 for the sum of rainfed and irrigated harvested crops. For the dominant crops (rice (1.7 million km2 harvested area), wheat (2.1 million km2), and maize (1.5 million km2)), roughly 60{\%}, 30{\%}, and 20{\%} of the harvested areas are irrigated, respectively, and half of the citrus, sugar cane, and cotton areas. While wheat and maize are the crops with the largest rainfed harvested areas (1.5 million km2 and 1.2 million km2, respectively), rice is clearly the crop with the largest irrigated harvested area (1.0 million km2), followed by wheat (0.7 million km2) and maize (0.3 million km2). Using MIRCA2000, 33{\%} of global crop production and 44{\%} of total cereal production were determined to come from irrigated agriculture.},

@article{Arnell_2003,
abstract = {This paper describes an analysis of different ways of constructing climate change scenarios using output from three climate models. It focuses on using the HadRM3H regional climate model applied across southern Africa and a macroscale runoff model operating at a scale of 0.5 × 0.5° to simulate river runoff. HadRM3H has a spatial resolution of 0.44 × 0.44° and is driven by boundary conditions from HadAM3H, a global atmosphere general circulation model with a spatial resolution of 1.875 × 1.25°. This, in turn, used sea-surface boundary conditions from HadCM3, a coupled global ocean-atmosphere general circulation model that operates at a spatial resolution of 3.75 × 2.5°. Sixteen climate scenarios were constructed from the three models, representing different combinations of model scale, whether the climate model simulations were used directly or changes were applied to an observed baseline, and whether observed or simulated variations from year-to-year were used. The different ways of deriving climate scenarios from a single initial climate model experiment result in a range in change in average annual runoff at a location of at least 10{\%}, and often more than 20{\%}. There is a clear difference in the large-scale spatial pattern of change in runoff from HadCM3 to HadRM3H. Many of the climate features in HadRM3H are already present in HadAM3H simulations, as would be expected from the experimental design. This suggests that for studies over a large geographic domain, an intermediate-resolution global climate model can produce useful scenarios for impact assessments. HadRM3H overestimates rainfall across much of southern Africa and so results in too much runoff: This leads to smaller estimates of future change in runoff than arise when changes in climate are applied to an observed climate baseline. It is concluded that under these circumstances it is preferable to apply modeled changes in climate to observed data to construct climate scenarios rather than derive these directly from the regional climate model simulations. Incorporating increases in interannual variability as simulated by HadRM3H leads to little change in simulated annual mean runoff. However, it has a larger impact on the frequency distributions of runoff, with extreme flows predicted to increase more than mean flows and even to increase in areas where the mean flow decreases. This demonstrates the importance of considering not only changes in mean climate but also climate variability.},

abstract = {Ice volume estimates are crucial for assessing water reserves stored in glaciers. Due to its large glacier coverage, such estimates are of particular interest for the Himalayan–Karakoram (HK) region. In this study, different existing methodologies are used to estimate the ice reserves: three area–volume relations, one slope-dependent volume estimation method, and two ice-thickness distribution models are applied to a recent, detailed, and complete glacier inventory of the HK region, spanning over the period 2000–2010 and revealing an ice coverage of 40 775 km2. An uncertainty and sensitivity assessment is performed to investigate the influence of the observed glacier area and important model parameters on the resulting total ice volume. Results of the two ice-thickness distribution models are validated with local ice-thickness measurements at six glaciers. The resulting ice volumes for the entire HK region range from 2955 to 4737 km3, depending on the approach. This range is lower than most previous estimates. Results from the ice thickness distribution models and the slope-dependent thickness estimations agree well with measured local ice thicknesses. However, total volume estimates from area-related relations are larger than those from other approaches. The study provides evidence on the significant effect of the selected method on results and underlines the importance of a careful and critical evaluation.},

abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment (FIFE) intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

@article{Ciarapica2002,
abstract = {The paper introduces a new distributed rainfall-runoff model derived upon the assumption that the horizontal flow at a point in the soil and over the surface can be approximated by means of a kinematic wave model. The point assumption is then integrated up to a finite pixel dimension, thus converting the original differential equation into a non-linear reservoir equation based upon physically meaningful parameters, the solution of which can be found numerically. The catchment behaviour is finally obtained by aggregating the non-linear reservoirs into three cascades, representing the soil, the surface and the drainage network, following the topographic and geomorphologic elements of the catchment. The main advantage of this approach lies in its capability of being applied at increasing spatial scales without losing the physical interpretation of the model and parameters. Other advantages of the TOPKAPI approach can be found in the full use of the digital elevation model, soil maps, land-use maps, etc., for the derivation of the non-linear reservoir cascade and for the estimate of the model parameters. This allows for the extension of the model to ungauged catchments and as a promising tool for the impact assessment of climatic as well as land-use changes. Three case-studies are presented, showing the model application to catchments that are different in nature and size (from a few to over a thousand square kilometres) and described by means of widely different elementary grid cells (pixels). The results of these applications are interesting, and they essentially fulfil the general purpose. Although the work to be done is still great, the model appears to be a promising tool worthy of further investigation.},

Eight models of WCRP-CMIP3 and WCRP-CMIP5 were compared to identify improvements in the reliability of projections from new generation models. While no significant differences are observed between both datasets, some improvements were found in the new generation models. For example, in summer CMIP5 inter-model variability of temperature was lower over northeastern Argentina, Paraguay and northern Brazil, in the last decades of the 21st century. Reliability of temperature projections from both sets of models is high, with signal to noise ratio greater than 1 over most of the study region. Although no major differences were observed in both precipitation datasets, CMIP5 inter-model variability was lower over northern and eastern Brazil in summer (especially at the end of the 21st century). Reliability of precipitation projections was low in both datasets. However, the signal to noise ratio in new generation models was close to 1, and even greater than 1 over eastern Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil in some seasons. {\textcopyright}2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Quantifying the hydrologic responses to land use /land cover change and climate variability is essential for integrated sustainable watershed management in water limited regions such as the Loess Plateau in Northwestern China where an adaptive watershed management approach is being implemented. Traditional empirical modeling approach to quantifying the accumulated hydrologic effects of watershed management is limited due to its complex nature of soil and water conservation practices (e. g., biological, structural, and agricultural measures) in the region. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the distributed hydrologic model, MIKE SHE to simulate basin runoff. Streamflow data measured from an overland flow-dominant watershed (12 km(2)) in northwestern China were used for model evaluation. Model calibration and validation suggested that the model could capture the dominant runoff process of the small watershed. We found that the physically based model required calibration at appropriate scales and estimated model parameters were influenced by both temporal and spatial scales of input data. We concluded that the model was useful for understanding the rainfall-runoff mechanisms. However, more measured data with higher temporal resolution are needed to further test the model for regional applications.},

@article{Hewitson1996,
abstract = {Downscaling, or translation across scales, is a term adopted in recent years to describe a set of techniques that relate local- and regional-scale climate variables to the larger scale atmospheric forcing. Conceptually, this is a direct evolution of more traditional techniques in synoptic climatology; however, the downscaling approach was developed specifically to address present needs in global environmental change research, and the need for more detailed temporal and spatial information from Global Climate Models (GCMs). Two general categories exist for downscaling techniques: process based techniques focused on nested models, and empirical techniques using one form or another of transfer function between scales. While in the long term nested models hold the greatest promise for regional-scale analysis, this approach is still in development, requires detailed surface climate data, and is dependent on high end computer availability. Conversely, empirical relationships offer a more immediate solution and significantly lower computing requirements, consequently offering an approach that can be rapidly adopted by a wider community of scientists. In this paper, an application of empirical downscaling of regional precipitation is implemented to demonstrate its effectiveness for evaluating GCM simulations and developing regional climate change scenarios. Gridded analyses of synoptic-scale circulation fields are related to regional precipitation using neural nets. Comparable GCM circulation fields are then used with the derived relationships to investigate control simulation and doubled atmospheric CO2 simulation synoptic-scale forcing on regional climates},

Digital elevation data are used to model topographic controls on incoming solar radiation, air temperature, precipitation, and downslope water movement. Canopy evapotranspiration is represented via a two-layer Penman-Monteith formulation that incorporates local net solar radiation, surface meteorology, soil characteristics and moisture status, and species-dependent leaf area index and stomatal resistance. Snow accumulation and ablation are modeled using an energy balance approach that includes the effects of local topography and vegetation cover. Saturated subsurface flow is modeled using a quasi three-dimensional routing scheme. The model was applied at 180-m scale to the Middle Fork Flathead River basin in northwestern Montana. This 2900-km{\^{}}2, snowmelt-dominated watershed ranges in elevation from 900 to over 3000 m. The model was calibrated using 2 years of recorded precipitation and stream flow. The model was verified against 2 additional years of runoff and against advanced very high resolution radiometer based spatial snow cover data at the 1-km{\^{}}2 scale. Simulated discharge showed acceptable agreement with observations. The simulated areal patterns of snow cover were in general agreement with the remote sensing observations, but were lagged slightly in time. -Surface Runoff},

Seasonally and regionally averaged precipitation and surface air temperature for the future period of [2070-2099] as compared to the period of [1961-1990] are considered. The dominant source of uncertainty in the simulation of average regional climate change is due to inter-model variability with inter-scenario and internal model variability playing secondary roles. The range of predicted climate changes by different realizations of the same ensemble is small, and simulated changes exhibit a high level of coherency among different forcing scenarios. Uncertainties in regional changes are 3 K or greater for temperature and 25{\%} of present day values or greater for precipitation.

These four surface models, embodying different complexities of the evaporation/hydrology treatment, included the traditional simple bucket model, the simple water balance (SWB) model, the Oregon State University (OSU) model, and the simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) model, The bucket model overestimated the evaporation during wet periods, and this resulted in unrealistically large negative sensible heat fluxes. The SWB model, despite its simple evaporation formulation, simulated well the evaporation during wet periods, but it tended to underestimate the evaporation during dry periods. Overall, the OSU model ably simulated the observed seasonal and diurnal variation in evaporation, soil moisture, sensible heat flux, and surface skin temperature, The more complex SSiB model performed similarly to the OSU model. A range of sensitivity experiments showed that some complexity in the canopy resistance scheme is important in reducing both the overestimation of evaporation during wet periods and underestimation during dry periods. Properly parameterizing not only the effect of soil moisture stress but also other canopy resistance factors, such as the vapor pressure deficit stress, is critical for canopy resistance evaluation, An overly simple canopy resistance that includes only soil moisture stress is unable to simulate observed surface evaporation during dry periods. Given a modestly comprehensive time-dependent canopy resistance treatment, a rather simple surface model such as the OSU model can provide good area-averaged surface heat fluxes for mesoscale atmospheric models.},

abstract = {A clear understanding of all the components of the water balance is essential to analyze possible measures of water savings in irrigated agriculture. However, most components of the water balance are not easily measurable either in terms of the required time interval or the complexity of the processes. For an irrigated area in the Western part of Turkey, the physically based one-dimensional agro-hydrological model SWAP for water transport and crop growth was applied in a distributed manner to reveal all the terms of the water balance. A combination of point data and distributed areal data was used as input for the model. The emphasis was put on the conversion from available data to required data. Simulations were carried out for the period 1985–1996 and detailed analyses were performed for two successive years, a pre-drought year, 1988, and a dry year, 1989. Irrigation deliveries were reduced substantially in 1989, resulting in a modified water balance. Lateral fluxes to drains were reduced, bottom fluxes were changed from groundwater recharge to capillary rise, evapotranspiration was lower, and, most importantly, relative yield was reduced. All these changes were obtained for specific sites by combining existing soil data with cropping patterns. It was concluded that the use of the SWAP model in a distributed way is a useful tool to analyze all the components of the water balance for a whole irrigation system.},

abstract = {Probable changes in mean and extreme precipitation in East Africa are estimated from general circulation models (GCMs) prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Bayesian statistics are used to derive the relative weights assigned to each member in the multimodel ensemble. There is substantial evidence in support of a positive shift of the whole rainfall distribution in East Africa during the wet seasons. The models give indications for an increase in mean precipitation rates and intensity of high rainfall events but for less severe droughts. Upward precipitation trends are projected from early this (twenty first) century. As in the observations, a statistically significant link between sea surface temperature gradients in the tropical Indian Ocean and short rains (October–December) in East Africa is simulated in the GCMs. Furthermore, most models project a differential warming of the Indian Ocean during boreal autumn. This is favorable for an increase in the probability of positive Indian Ocean zonal mode events, which have been associated with anomalously strong short rains in East Africa. On top of the general increase in rainfall in the tropics due to thermodynamic effects, a change in the structure of the Eastern Hemisphere Walker circulation is consistent with an increase in East Africa precipitation relative to other regions within the same latitudinal belt. A notable feature of this change is a weakening of the climatological subsidence over eastern Kenya. East Africa is shown to be a region in which a coherent projection of future precipitation change can be made, supported by physical arguments. Although the rate of change is still uncertain, almost all results point to a wetter climate with more intense wet seasons and less severe droughts.},

abstract = {In regions with frequent water stress and large aquifer systems groundwater is often used as an additional water source. If groundwater abstraction exceeds the natural groundwater recharge for extensive areas and long times, overexploitation or persistent groundwater depletion occurs. Here we provide a global overview of groundwater depletion (here defined as abstraction in excess of recharge) by assessing groundwater recharge with a global hydrological model and subtracting estimates of groundwater abstraction. Restricting our analysis to sub-humid to arid areas we estimate the total global groundwater depletion to have increased from 126 (32) km 3 a -1 in 1960 to 283 (40) km 3 a -1 in 2000. The latter equals 39 (10){\%} of the global yearly groundwater abstraction, 2 (0.6){\%} of the global yearly groundwater recharge, 0.8 (0.1){\%} of the global yearly continental runoff and 0.4 (0.06){\%} of the global yearly evaporation, contributing a considerable amount of 0.8 (0.1) mm a -1 to current sea-level rise. {\textcopyright}2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The authors describe the construction of a 0.5° lat–long gridded dataset of monthly terrestrial surface climate for the period of 1901–96. The dataset comprises a suite of seven climate elements: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapor pressure, cloud cover, and ground frost frequency. The spatial coverage extends over all land areas, including oceanic islands but excluding Antarctica. Fields of monthly climate anomalies, relative to the 1961–90 mean, were interpolated from surface climate data. The anomaly grids were then combined with a 1961–90 mean monthly climatology (described in Part I) to arrive at grids of monthly climate over the 96-yr period. The primary variables—precipitation, mean temperature, and diurnal temperature range—were interpolated directly from station observations. The resulting time series are compared with other coarser-resolution datasets of similar temporal extent. The remaining climatic elements, termed secondary variables, were interpolated from merged datasets comprising station observations and, in regions where there were no station data, synthetic data estimated using predictive relationships with the primary variables. These predictive relationships are described and evaluated. It is argued that this new dataset represents an advance over other products because (i) it has higher spatial resolution than other datasets of similar temporal extent, (ii) it has longer temporal coverage than other products of similar spatial resolution, (iii) it encompasses a more extensive suite of surface climate variables than available elsewhere, and (iv) the construction method ensures that strict temporal fidelity is maintained. The dataset should be of particular relevance to a number of applications in applied climatology, including large-scale biogeochemical and hydrological modeling, climate change scenario construction, evaluation of regional climate models, and comparison with satellite products. The dataset is available from the Climatic Research Unit and is currently being updated to 1998.},

abstract = {The emergence of regional and global satellite-based rainfall products with high spatial and temporal resolution has opened up new large-scale hydrological applications in data-sparse or ungauged catchments. Particularly, distributed hydrological models can benefit from the good spatial coverage and distributed nature of satellite-based rainfall estimates (SRFE). In this study, five SRFEs with temporal resolution of 24 h and spatial resolution between 8 and 27 km have been evaluated through their predictive capability in a distributed hydrological model of the Senegal River basin in West Africa. The main advantage of this evaluation methodology is the integration of the rainfall model input in time and space when evaluated at the sub-catchment scale. An initial data analysis revealed significant biases in the SRFE products and large variations in rainfall amounts between SRFEs, although the spatial patterns were similar. The results showed that the Climate Prediction Center/Famine Early Warning System (CPC-FEWS) and cold cloud duration (CCD) products, which are partly based on rain gauge data and produced specifically for the African continent, performed better in the modelling context than the global SRFEs, Climate Prediction Center MORPHing technique (CMORPH), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). The best performing SRFE, CPC-FEWS, produced good results with values of R2NS between 0{\textperiodcentered}84 and 0{\textperiodcentered}87 after bias correction and model recalibration. This was comparable to model simulations based on traditional rain gauge data. The study highlights the need for input specific calibration of hydrological models, since major differences were observed in model performances even when all SRFEs were scaled to the same mean rainfall amounts. This is mainly attributed to differences in temporal dynamics between products.},

This was performed by using a physically based, well-tested simulation model for crop growth, water and salt transport at field scale. Data used were from an existing dataset and missing data were obtained by converting data from the available set to the required ones. Results indicate that the current practice of 900 mm annual application rates for cotton, given the current salinity level of 4 dS m−1, is close to the optimal one. Graphs are presented to evaluate the effect of different combinations of application rates and salinity levels on yields, and the water and salt balances. It was concluded that the methodology presented here is versatile, rapid, and transferable to other conditions. Moreover, the method produces output at a high spatial and temporal resolution over a long time frame.},
